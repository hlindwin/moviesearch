      "Short Films SCROLL DOWN Short Films At Pixar, we LOVE shorts! In fact, our first ventures in storytelling through film were with short films and commercials. Beginning with Luxo Jr., shorts have allowed us to tell stories in different ways than our feature films, but often with just as much emotional impact. Innovative storytelling has always been at the core of Pixar’s foundation, and our shorts allow the freedom to experiment and develop both new ways to tell stories and new technologies – many of which often then go on to be used in our feature films. Just as important, our short films also allow us to cultivate the next generation of storytellers here at the studio, letting individuals work on smaller teams and often hold leadership positions for the first time. Since the beginning of Pixar, short form storytelling has been a passion at the studio, and it will continue to be an important part of our future.

      "Coco Character Design World Design Credits Coco SCROLL DOWN Coco Coco en Español – Theatre Listings Spanish Dubbed/Subtitled Theatre Listings U.S. RELEASE DATE: NOVEMBER 22, 2017 DIRECTOR: LEE UNKRICH CO-DIRECTOR : ADRIAN MOLINA PRODUCER: DARLA K. ANDERSON Despite his family’s baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt). Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events. Along the way, he meets charming trickster Hector (voice of Gael García Bernal), and together, they set off on an extraordinary journey to unlock the real story behind Miguel's family history. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Inhabiting the Land of the Dead is a rich and vibrant community. But these characters had to be built without many of the usual traits because they are all skeletons. “We had to figure out how to give them personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips,” says character art director Daniel Arriaga. “We played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. We sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to figure out where we could add appeal and charm.” Miguel Miguel is a 12-year-old who struggles against his family’s generations-old ban on music. “Miguel secretly nurtures this love of music,” says director Lee Unkrich. “He’s constructed a guitar and designed it to mimic Ernesto’s iconic skull guitar. And he’s taught himself to play.” #block-yui_3_17_2_71_1508255910947_5614 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -23px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_71_1508255910947_5614 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 23px; margin-bottom: 23px; } Héctor Héctor, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, enlists Miguel’s help to visit the Land of the Living. “He desperately wants to cross the marigold bridge on Día de los Muertos,” says co-director Adrian Molina. “But there's a rule that if no one in the Land of the Living is actively remembering you—if no one has put your photo up on an Ofrenda—then there's no one in the Land of the Living to receive you and you cannot cross over.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_44149 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_44149 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dante Dante is a Xolo dog—short for Xoloitzcuintli—the national dog of Mexico. Nearly hairless, Dante has trouble keeping his tongue in his mouth due to his missing teeth—but he’s a loyal companion to Miguel. “Dante is Miguel’s confidant, the only character he shares his music with,” says screenwriter Matthew Aldrich. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_79819 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_79819 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Ernesto de la Cruz Miguel’s idol Ernesto de la Cruz, is the most famous musician in the history of Mexico. Revered by fans worldwide until his untimely death, the charming and charismatic musician is even more beloved in the Land of the Dead. “Ernesto de la Cruz’s catchphrase was ‘Seize your moment,’” says director Lee Unkrich. “And Miguel takes that to heart.” To support Miguel’s adoration of Ernesto, filmmakers realized they would need to build the career of the fictional performer. Co-director Adrian Molina teamed up with songwriter/composer Germaine Franco to write some of the songs in Ernesto’s repertoire. “Music is important to Miguel and it anchors Ernesto’s character,” says Molina. “So we wanted to write a few songs that would demonstrate the kind of performer that Ernesto was and maybe show what makes him so popular.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_105786 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_105786 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Abuelita Abuelita is Miguel’s grandmother and the ultimate enforcer of the Rivera family rules. She loves her family very much and will do anything to protect them. But when she gets angry, she wields a mean shoe. “Abuelita is the torchbearer when it comes to the family’s rule where music is concerned,” says director Lee Unkrich. “She can be warm and loving one moment and sharp-tongued and strict the next. That’s what’s so entertaining about her—you never know what you’re going to get.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_149131 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_149131 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Pepita Pepita is an alebrije who fills the role of Mamá Imelda’s spirit guide. Brightly colored and fiercely loyal, Pepita is a formidable presence in the Land of the Dead. An imposing wildcat with eagle talons and impressive wings, Pepita is an alebrije brought-to-life. “Alebrijes are traditional brightly colored and handcrafted Mexican folk art,” says story supervisor Jason Katz. “They’re dreamlike animals—lizards with rabbit ears, elephants with butterfly wings—beautifully rendered with striking colors, and we knew from the moment we saw them that they needed to have a place in our story.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_300120 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_300120 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mamá Imelda Mamá Imelda, Miguel’s great-great-grandmother, is the matriarch of the Rivera family and the founder of their successful shoemaking business. Miguel meets Mamá Imelda in the Land of the Dead and discovers she really does not share his passion for music. “Imelda is the source of the family’s ban on music,” says director Lee Unkrich. “Long ago, she was married to a musician, but she found that he had very different priorities in life. She wanted to raise a family, but he couldn’t let go of his love of music.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_190087 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_190087 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Frida Frida, a ground breaking artistic figure in Mexican culture, continues her expressive vision in the Land Of The Dead and is one of Miguel’s first artistic allies, helping him to see that a life of an artist could actually be more than just a dream. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_241236 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_241236 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Music “Coco” is about family, connecting with loved ones and pursuing your dreams. And according to director Lee Unkrich, it’s all rooted in music. “‘Coco’ has music in its DNA,” says Unkrich. “Music shapes the film. Some characters are musicians, while others want nothing to do with it.” Co-director Adrian Molina says that the Rivera family’s ban on music did not deter the “Coco” filmmakers. “Our main character, Miguel, is so passionate about music and he is really talented,” says Molina. “So his journey to pursue his dream is naturally filled with music. We have traditional Mexican music, original songs written for the film and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino.” According to Unkrich, the filmmakers wanted the film to honor its setting, but with an unexpected quality. “We encouraged the team to be true to traditional Mexican music, but gave them the freedom to embrace new sounds,” he says. “Our main goal is for the audience to walk away from the film feeling like they visited Santa Cecilia and spent time in the Land of the Dead,” adds Tom MacDougall, executive vice president of music at Disney. “If we can give them an authentic musical experience, it will help them make a lasting connection to the film.” Fortunately, the Rivera family’s ban on music doesn’t extend to the film itself. “I love the irony,” says producer Darla K. Anderson. “We have a family with this inexplicable objection to music who live in a country that’s rooted in it. In ‘Coco,’ we pay homage to all different styles of Mexican music.” Mamá Coco Miguel’s cherished great-grandmother Mamá Coco is very old and fragile, but that doesn’t stop Miguel from sharing his daily adventures with her. According to Director Lee Unkrich, filmmakers were touched by so many of the Mexican homes they visited in which multiple generations lived under the same roof. “Babies were at home alongside their great-grandmothers,” says Unkrich. “We wanted to embrace that. Even as her own memory is slipping away, Mamá Coco will always be surrounded by people who love her.” #block-yui_3_17_2_45_1508800867475_11236 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -23px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_45_1508800867475_11236 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 23px; margin-bottom: 23px; } The Rivera Family Papá, Miguel’s supportive father, hopes that someday Miguel will join him in the family shoemaking business. After all, a Rivera is a shoemaker through and through. Miguel’s loving Mamá gently encourages her son to embrace their family’s traditions. She and Papá are expecting a new little brother or sister for Miguel. Miguel’s ancestors also include his late aunt Tía Rosita, his great-grandfather Papá Julio and his identical twin uncles Tío Oscar and Tío Felipe. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_455008 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_455008 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Chicharrón Chicharrón is a curmudgeonly friend of Héctor’s who is sadly being forgotten—an unfortunate condition in the Land of the Dead. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_599413 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_599413 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Skeletons Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup came on board early in the production to address potential issues for “Coco”—and creating skeletons certainly qualified. “The skeletons can detach their bones and do little gags. Even their vertebrae comes apart,” says Northrup. “Each piece had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_642771 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_642771 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Research “As soon as we decided that we wanted to tell a story that takes place in Mexico, we immediately booked our first research trip,” says director Lee Unkrich. “Over the course of three years, we visited museums, markets, plazas, workshops, churches, haciendas and cemeteries throughout Mexico,” says Unkrich. “Families welcomed us into their homes and taught us about the foods they enjoy, the music they listen to, their livelihoods and their traditions. Most importantly, we witnessed the importance they place on family.” That, according to Unkrich, is what ultimately sparked the story. “We really wanted to explore the family bonds that tie us to the generations that came before us,” he says. “This story is about celebrating our past—even as we look to the future.” The Land Of The Dead For the Land of the Living and Santa Cecilia, filmmakers were able to find inspiration in the vibrant towns they visited in Mexico. But when it came time to create the Land of the Dead, the rules were much less defined. “I didn’t want to have just a free-for-all, wacky world,” says director Lee Unkrich. “There needed to be some logic to it. We realized that it would need to be ever-expanding because new residents would arrive regularly, if you think about it. So we asked ourselves, ‘What would a world look like that was being added onto constantly?’” Filmmakers looked to Mexico City’s ancient history. The city was originally built on the site of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán, which was surrounded by water. And while that water has mostly disappeared, artists found the idea very compelling—a city literally sprung from the water. “That lent itself to this idea of towers,” says Unkrich. “Almost like coral growing up and out representing layers of history.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_702775 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_702775 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Santa Cecilia “Santa Cecilia is inspired by real villages in Mexico,” says production designer Harley Jessup. “We stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living. It’s sun-bleached and dusty, but the color palette is accented by the brightly colored decorations for Día de Muertos. There’s a town square where people gather, the Rivera compound where Miguel’s great-great-grandmother built the family’s shoe business, and the local cemetery is prominently featured.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_734645 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_734645 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Cemetery As the locals prepare for Día de Muertos, the Santa Cecilia cemetery is filled with brilliantly colored marigolds and celosia blossoms, as well as handmade decorations and hundreds of candles. “What we saw in Mexico for the holiday really redefines the idea of a cemetery,” says Danielle Feinberg, director of photography - lighting. “It’s not dark and sad; it’s festive. Thousands of candles put off this beautiful orange glow, which creates a wonderful mood—romantic, warm, and interesting. I’ve never seen anything like it.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_763162 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_763162 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Marigold Bridge As filmmakers created the two worlds of “Coco,” they knew they’d need to connect the worlds in a very magical way. Their research trips sparked something spectacular. “When we were invited to take part in Día de Muertos in Mexico,” says director Lee Unkrich, “we saw paths made of marigold petals that started out in the streets and ended at ofrendas—altars with family pictures, favorite foods and special objects. We learned that it was all done to help guide the spirit of a family’s loved one home.” #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_802093 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_802093 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Las Ofrendas During the Día de los Muertos celebration families create ofrendas (altars) which honor the spirits of loved ones who have passed. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_844613 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_844613 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Department of Family Reunions Located within Marigold Grand Central Station is the Department of Family Reunions, where all of the family records are kept. According to Production Designer Harley Jessup, the space is designed in the spirit of a “Victorian DMV,” with skull and skeleton motifs incorporated into the architecture. Families come to the Department of Family Reunions if they’re having problems with crossing over to the Land of the Living. Employed here is a clerk, who assists Miguel and his family in his cluttered, yet cozy office #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_881008 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1508862361838_881008 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits DIRECTED BY Lee Unkrich CO-DIRECTED BY Adrian Molina PRODUCED BY Darla K.

      "Our Story to infinity and beyond Our Story SCROLL DOWN Our Story THE BEGINNINGS: A LAMP CALLED LUXO (1979-1991) 1979 George Lucas recruits Ed Catmull from the New York Institute of Technology to head Lucasfilm’s Computer Division, a group charged with developing state-of-the-art computer technology for the film industry. Lucas’s wish list: a digital (nonlinear) film editing system, a digital (nonlinear) sound editing system, a laser film printer, and further exploration of computer graphics. 1982 The Computer Division completes the “Genesis Effect” sequence for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan . The scene, which shows an initially lifeless planet being rapidly transformed by lush vegetation, is the first completely computer animated sequence in a feature film. 1983 The Computer Division’s Graphics Group creates their first film-resolution image, “The Road to Point Reyes.” Near the end of the year, animator John Lasseter is invited to come up to the Bay Area to do some freelance work with the Graphics Group. 1984 Lasseter is hired full-time, joining the Computer Division as an “Interface Designer.” A partially completed version of “ The Adventures of André & Wally B .” premieres at SIGGRAPH. It is the first short film created by the future animation studio, featuring complex flexible characters, hand-painted textures, and motion blur. It is also the first example of character animation in the young medium of computer animation. At SIGGRAPH, the Computer Division also shows off its prototype Pixar Image Computer. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_30879 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_30879 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } 1985 The Computer Division completes the Stained Glass Knight sequence that appears in the film Young Sherlock Holmes . 1986 Steve Jobs purchases the Computer Division from George Lucas and establishes the group as an independent company, “ Pixar. ” At this time about 40 people are employed. Pixar and Disney begin collaboration on CAPS, the Computer Animation Production System, which would revolutionize the creation of traditional animated films. The first check written to Pixar by a client after its incorporation is from Disney, for work on this project. “ Luxo Jr. ” is completed. The short film, John Lasseter’s official directorial debut, is unveiled in August at SIGGRAPH and then screened for general audiences at Los Angeles-area theaters in November. “Luxo Jr.” will go on to become the first three-dimensional computer animated film to be nominated for an Oscar®, receiving a nomination for Best Short Film (Animated). #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_67473 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -9px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_67473 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px; } “ Red’s Dream ” is completed and premieres at SIGGRAPH. A portion of the film is rendered entirely on the Pixar Image Computer. 1988 Pixar’s proprietary animation system, identified to the outside world as Marionette but internally known as Menv (“men-vee”), short for “modeling environment,” comes online. Pixar’s proprietary renderer, RenderMan®, also makes its internal debut. Both pieces of software are used to produce “ Tin Toy ,” Pixar’s third short film. A partially completed version of “Tin Toy” is screened at SIGGRAPH, with the finished film premiering later that year at the Ottawa International Film Fest. “Tin Toy ” will go on to become the first computer animated film to receive an Academy Award® when it is named Best Short Film (Animated) the following year. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_197310 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -12px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1417648443999_197310 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; } 1989 “ Knick Knac k ” is completed. A work-in-progress version is screened at that year’s SIGGRAPH. It is Pixar’s first animation produced in stereoscopic 3D. The first commercial version of RenderMan® is released. Pixar begins making commercials. The first is an ad for Tropicana orange juice, “Wake Up,” directed by John Lasseter. 1990 Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter join the company. By the end of the year, each animates a commercial – Andrew Stanton completes “Quite A Package” for Trident, and Pete Docter animates “Boxer” for Listerine. Pixar’s commercial work gives the company invaluable experience in pitching, storytelling, and working with clients, and allows it to develop and refine its production pipeline. 1991 Disney and Pixar announce an agreement “to make and distribute at least one computer-generated animated movie.” Pixar begins work on the project that will become Toy Story, while continuing to produce commercials and other short materials, including spots for public television. to infinity and beyond SCROLL DOWN to infinity and beyond 1995 Toy Story , the world’s first computer animated feature film, is released in theaters on November 22.

Pixar’s initial public offering takes place just days later, on November 28. It is the largest IPO of the year. 1996 Toy Story is recognized with Academy Award® nominations for Best Original Song, Best Original Score, and Best Original Screenplay—the first time an animated film is recognized for screenwriting. John Lasseter receives a Special Achievement Oscar® from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his “inspired leadership of the Pixar Toy Story Team resulting in the first feature-length computer animated film.” Pixar announces that it will stop making commercials in order to concentrate on longer-format and interactive entertainment. #block-0cda63231d3e16d01368 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-0cda63231d3e16d01368 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } 1997 The Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation Studios announce an agreement to jointly produce five movies over 10 years. 1998 Groundbreaking for Pixar’s Emeryville studio begins. \" A Bug's Life \" is released in theaters on November 25, accompanied by the short film “ Geri’s Game .” 1999 Toy Story 2 is released in theaters on November 24.

      "Toy Story Character Design World Design Awards Credits Toy Story SCROLL DOWN Toy Story Ever wonder what toys do when people aren't around? Toy Story answers that question with a fantastic fun-filled journey, viewed mostly through the eyes of two rival toys – Woody, the lanky, likable cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear, the fearless space ranger. Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily in his room until Andy's birthday brings Buzz Lightyear onto the scene. Afraid of losing his place in Andy's heart, Woody plots against Buzz. But when circumstances separate Buzz and Woody from their owner, the comically-mismatched duo eventually learn to put aside their differences, and they find themselves on a hilarious adventure-filled mission where the only way they can survive is to form an uneasy alliance. Trailers Pixar’s creative team turned to the experienced hands at Disney to help create a feature-length film with broad appeal. Disney executives wanted to ensure Toy Story had an edge, and the Pixar team pushed the edge until one Friday—a year into production—when they showed a rough cut to Disney. It wasn’t the film John Lasseter and Pixar wanted to make. It wasn’t the film Disney wanted, either, and the studio ordered the production shut down. It was up to the Pixar team to trust its instincts and save the movie. Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The filmmakers assembled the Toy Story cast from a wealth of childhood memories. But for the story to work, the two main characters needed to have their own chemistry. Early versions of Woody included a ventriloquist's dummy and an ill-tempered cowboy before he became the affable hero seen on screen. Buzz Lightyear offered a different challenge: inventing a brand-new toy that instantly felt familiar. Animation Design Modeling Woody Woody is a traditional kind of toy, with his pull-string voice box and cowboy detailing. He has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's toys—until Buzz Lightyear crash-lands and shakes up his world. #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_40994 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_40994 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Buzz Lightyear This space ranger action figure has it all: a laser beam, karate-chop action, pop-out wings, and a belief that he's on a secret mission for Star Command. Much to Woody's chagrin, Buzz monopolizes Andy's attention and becomes an instant favorite with his toymates. #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_69745 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_69745 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Hamm The piggy bank in the window knows everything.

His cynical take on life makes him the toy to question Woody's authority. #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_107978 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_65_1471022474753_107978 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Rex Rex is a neurotic and insecure 12-inch plastic dinosaur with a small-roar complex and limited upper-arm movement. With his tender heart and weak spine, this Tyrannosaurus is one of the most lovable toys of the bunch. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_43546 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_43546 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Slinky A dog is man's best friend, and the saying rings true for those of the vinyl variety, too. Slinky is Woody's trusted friend and partner in playing checkers—and the one who \"stretches\" the most in the friendship. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_62223 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_62223 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mutant Toys The toys next door to Andy are an odd-looking bunch of hybrids that are the product of Sid's twisted sense of playtime. Despite their shocking outward appearances, the creations are truly selfless and gentle at the core, helping each other to survive and hopefully outgrow Sid. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_82955 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_82955 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sid Every neighborhood has a bully, and Sid's it on Andy's block. He's a malicious and overactive kid who loves to torture, torment, and blow up toys all in the name of fun. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_111407 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1471891945164_111407 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Andy Able to create elaborate gold-mining towns with boxes and crayons, Andy can dream up any prop for a good vs. evil scenario that stars all of his toys. With Andy in charge, good always triumphs. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471898352317_52623 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471898352317_52623 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Production Tour Sound Design Andy's House Andy’s room was a world of its own, home to most of Toy Story’s characters and a place that immediately conveyed comfort and safety. That sense of safety provided the conflict as the characters faced new anxieties like leaving the house and welcoming a new toy. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_29431 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_29431 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dinoco Station Every set offered an opportunity and a challenge. The test for the neighborhood Dinoco station was to replicate the style and sheen of the classic 1950s gas station, while adding just the right touch of harsh light, oil stains, and cement texture to make it believable. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_40894 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_40894 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Pizza Planet In an early version of the film, the pizza parlor had a miniature golf theme. When Buzz Lightyear entered the picture, the Pixar designers turned it into Pizza Planet, an elaborate space-themed drive-in that Buzz could mistake for a spaceport and his ticket home. It also supplied the name and logo for the Pizza Planet delivery truck, which went on to make cameos in several Pixar films. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_49940 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_49940 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sid's House Movie villains are often more fun than the straight guy, and many on the Pixar team found they related to the mutant impulses of Sid, the bad boy next door. “ I think Sid is normal, ” says Andrew Stanton. “ I think Andy is the weird one, this boy who takes care of his toys. ” Coming up with disturbing new creations to populate Sid’s room became one of the most popular tasks in Toy Story. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_60490 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1471908391624_60490 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Winner of Special Achievement Award \"for his inspired leadership of the Pixar Toy Story team, resulting in the first feature-length computer-animated film\" John Lasseter Nominated for Music (Original Music or Comedy Score) Randy Newman Nominated for Music (Original Song) - 'You've Got a Friend in Me' Randy Newman Nominated for Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for Screen) Screenplay by Joss Whedon Andrew StantoN Joel Cohen Alec Sokolow Story by John Lasseter Peter Docter Andrew Stanton Joe Ranft Annie Awards Winner for Outstanding Achievement in Animated Theatrical Feature Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Animation Pete Docter Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Directing John Lasseter Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Music Randy Newman Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Producing Bonnie Arnold & Ralph Guggenheim Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Production Design Ralph Eggleston Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Technical Achievemen Winner for Best Individual Achievement: Writing Andrew Stanton Joss Whedon Joel Cohen Alec Sokolow Ars Electronica Winner of Golden Nica for Computer Animation: John Lasseter Australian Effects & Animation Festival Winner for Feature Films Golden Globe Awards Nominated for Best Original Song 'You've Got a Friend in Me' Randy Newman Nominated for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy International Teleproduction Society Winner of International Monitor Award for Best Electronic Special Effects (Theatrical Releases) Los Angeles Critics Association Winner for Best Animation John Lasseter Producers Guild of America Winner of Special Award of Merit Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits DIRECTED BY John Lasseter EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS Edwin Catmull, Steven Jobs PRODUCED BY Ralph Guggenheim, Bonnie Arnold SUPERVISING TECHNICAL DIRECTOR William Reeves MUSIC BY Randy Newman SONGS WRITTEN & PERFORMED BY Randy Newman ORIGINAL STORY BY John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft SCREENPLAY BY Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow ART DIRECTOR Ralph Eggleston FILM EDITORS Robert Gordon, Lee Unkrich SUPERVISING ANIMATOR Pete Docter SOUND DESIGN Gary Rydstrom PRODUCTION SUPERVISOR Karen Robert Jackson Cast Woody Tom Hanks Buzz Lightyear Tim Allen Mr. Potato Head Don Rickles Slinky Dog Jim Varney Rex Wallace Shawn Hamm John Ratzenberger Bo Peep Annie Potts Andy John Morris Sid Erik Von Detten Mrs. Davis Laurie Metcalf Sergeant R.

      "Piper SCROLL DOWN Piper \"Piper\" tells the story of a hungry sandpiper hatchling who ventures from her nest for the first time to dig for food by the shoreline. The only problem is, the food is buried beneath the sand where scary waves roll up onto the shore. After watching Sandpipers react to waves and run on the beach, Director Alan Barillaro was inspired to design \"Piper’s\" main character - the young sandpiper who is afraid of the water yet has to venture into it to eat. The production began as an attempt to craft an animation tool that would help provide additional creative flexibility to the studio’s filmmaking process. Pixar’s software development team created a proof of concept, a short animation test using the sandpiper on a beach. This animation test soon grew into a full-fledged short film."

      "Andre & Wally B SCROLL DOWN Andre & Wally B There's nothing like a restful nap in a pleasant wooded valley. But when André awakens and is greeted by a pesky yellow-and-black striped insect with a nasty stinger, he ends up taking a quick (and painful) hike. André thinks he's a clever guy, able to outsmart and outrun a bee. But like all stinging insects, Wally B. knows better and can chase down any target in a matter of seconds. Though this film was made at Lucasfilm, Pixar is featuring it here because it was the first time John Lasseter worked on a 3D animated film. \"André and Wally B.\" was very restrictive—only geometric shapes could be animated—but Lasseter pushed the envelope by asking the tech team for a teardrop shape that could be bent several ways, thus creating Wally B."

      "Luxo Jr SCROLL DOWN Luxo Jr A baby lamp finds a ball to play with and it's all fun and games until the ball bursts. Just when the elder Luxo thinks his kid will settle down for a bit, Luxo Jr. finds another ball—ten times larger. \"Luxo Jr.\" has a great parent in the larger lamp. Even though Jr. is a bit unpredictable, the elder Luxo gives him room to grow and explore. And the tiny light has no problem with that. When John Lasseter was learning how to make models, he chose the nearest, easiest subject: an architect's lamp sitting on his desk. He started moving it around in the animation system like it was alive, and it eventually became a Pixar short that was nominated for an Academy Award®."

      "Red's Dream SCROLL DOWN Red's Dream Life as the sole sale item in the clearance corner of Eben's Bikes can get lonely. So Red, a unicycle, dreams up a clown owner and his own juggling act that steals the show. But all too soon, the applause turns into the sound of rainfall as reality rushes back. Red must resign himself to sitting in the corner and await his fate. Don't let Red's sale tag fool you. He's really a priceless unicycle with a big heart who could help out juggling performers like Lumpy the Clown—if only someone would see him resting against the back wall and give him a chance. Nighttime scenes used to be uncommon in digital animated films until Pixar set off to explore the territory in this 1987 short film. But this challenge alone wasn't enough—the creative team had to add raindrops, juggling, and its first \"organic\" character, Lumpy the Clown, to the mix."

      "Tin Toy SCROLL DOWN Tin Toy Babies are hardly monster-like,unless you're a toy. After escaping a drooling baby, Tinny realizes that he wants to be played with after all. But in the amount of time it takes him to discover this, the baby's attention moves on to other things only an infant could find interesting. The secret's out: Curious crawling babies are why toys become \"lost\" beneath furniture and behind dressers. But the tin musical toy Tinny isn't like the other scared toys under the sofa. He knows his job is to make children laugh, not cry. \"Tin Toy\" marked the first time a character with lifelike bendable arms and knees, surfaces, and facial components was animated digitally. The challenge was balancing its \"cartoony\" look with a baby's real looks. The reward: an Academy Award® for Best Animated Short Film."

But just when the game's nearly over, Geri manages to turn the tables. There's Geri. And then there's the other Geri. You'd swear they were twins who haven't got along since birth. In reality, it's only one very old man who is young at heart, having a little fun with himself by faking a heart attack and finding new uses for his dentures. When Pixar sets out to do short films, it sometimes does so with research and development in mind. In \"Geri's Game\" , the challenge was to take human and cloth animation to new heights. The creative team succeeded, and Pixar won an Academy Award® for Best Animated Short Film as well."

      "For The Birds SCROLL DOWN For The Birds One by one, a flock of small birds perch on a telephone wire. Sitting close together has problems enough, but then along comes a large dopey bird that tries to join them. The birds of a feather can't help but make fun of him—and their clique mentality proves embarrassing in the end. Bully's the first bird to land on the wire. Then come Chipper, Snob, and Neurotic. You get a sense of their personalities until the rest of the flock arrives and they become one. The big bird doesn't know he's being made fun of but gets the last laugh just the same. \"For the Birds\" is deceptively simple. Take a closer look at this Academy Award®-winning short film and you'll notice each bird has countless feathers. It's not easy to digitally create feathers that look natural and move like they would in real life, but Pixar was able to work with its existing technology to make it happen."

      "Boundin' SCROLL DOWN Boundin' On a high mountain plain lives a lamb with wool of such remarkable sheen that he breaks into high-steppin' dance. But there comes a day when he loses his lustrous coat and his pride along with it. It takes a wise jackalope—a horn-adorned rabbit—to teach the moping lamb that, woolly or not, it's what's inside that'll help him rebound from life's troubles. For the lamb, life is an upbeat western waltz until his prairie friends tease him about his freshly sheared look. The only one who can set things right is the giant jackalope, who brings sunshine and optimism wherever he bounds. Writer-director Bud Luckey, a longtime Pixar animator and designer of Toy Story's Woody, found inspiration for \"Boundin'\" from the Montana of his youth. Starting with the most pathetic thing he'd ever seen—a newly shorn lamb in the rain—Luckey crafted a story told through song. To rescue his sad lamb, he brought in a jackalope, a mythical animal popular in America's Great Plains."

The little girl, Tippy, is caught in the middle as a musical duel ensues between the one-man bands. For Bass, it's just another day of playing the same old tired tune until Treble, a flashy, sophisticated newcomer, ups the tempo with his string accompaniment and charm. Bass must reach into his musical arsenal to rival Treble and impress the young girl who just wanted to make a wish. At Pixar, stories are usually first developed through scriptwriting and storyboarding, but music played such an integral part in \"One Man Band\" that the story and score had to be developed simultaneously. The musical sparring that's so entertaining in the final film is the direct result of the collaboration between the directors and the composer."

But abducting humans requires precision and a gentle touch, and within a few missteps it's painfully clear why more humans don't go missing every year. As if the teen years don't come with enough angst, Stu must remember the functions of thousands of identical buttons during his abduction exam—and his instructor, Mr. B., is quick to record his every incorrect move. Tears are the only thing that can melt Mr. B's hardened heart, but not for long. The similarity between Lifted's console and those used by sound mixers is no coincidence. Director Gary Rydstrom is a multiple-Oscar®-winner famous for his sound design on movies like Jurassic Park and Pixar's Finding Nemo . In \"Lifted\" , he found comic relief in conveying the experience of tackling an impossible task while under scrutiny."

      "Partly Cloudy SCROLL DOWN Partly Cloudy Everyone knows that the stork delivers babies, but where does the stork get the babies? The answer lies up in the stratosphere, where cloud people sculpt babies from clouds and bring them to life. Gus, a lonely and insecure grey cloud, is a master at creating \"dangerous\" babies. Crocodiles, porcupines, rams, and more—but Gus' beloved creations are more than a handful for his loyal delivery stork partner, Peck. As Gus' creations become more and more rambunctious, Peck's job gets harder and harder. How will Peck manage to handle both his hazardous cargo and his friend's fiery temperament? The challenge to make characters from clouds was one of the more daunting technical aspects for director Peter Sohn and his crew. Because a cloud is made up of nothing more than moisture and light, the designers and animators of \"Partly Cloudy\" had a difficult time determining what Gus should ultimately look like. Should Gus be more \"wispy and gassy\" or ghostlike? They finally settled on a caricatured version of a puffy cloud."

But as their suspicions turn to curiosity, they are delighted to find that this budding friendship can offer a new perspective on the world. Were they not the keepers of daylight and darkness, Day and Night would be a couple of average Joes—Day busy with sunshine and joggers, Night focused on stars and drive-in movies. But when their paths cross, Day and Night find that they are more alike than different—both are fearful and jealous but ultimately proud to share the best of themselves. And as they discover, they're better together than apart. The radio broadcast in \"Day & Night\" is taken from a talk given by Dr. Wayne Dyer,a motivational speaker and author. Director Teddy Newton remembered hearing Dr. Dyer on recordings his mother played when he was young, and he decided to incorporate one of the recordings into the film."

      "La Luna SCROLL DOWN La Luna \"La Luna\" is the timeless fable of a young boy coming of age in the most peculiar circumstances. Tonight is the very first time his Papa and Grandpa are taking him to work. In an old wooden boat they row far out to sea, and with no land in sight, they stop and wait. A big surprise awaits the little boy as he discovers his family's most unusual line of work. Should he follow the example of his Papa or his Grandpa? Will he be able to find his own way amidst their conflicting opinions and timeworn traditions? #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1418856223375_7627 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1418856223375_7627 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } There are three characters in \"La Luna\": a boy, his father, and his grandfather. At first glance, they are cut from the same mold. They wear overalls and hats; they carry brooms. But the contrast between them reveals their characters. Covered by the signs of age, the two adult men’s eyes cannot be seen. Nor can they see as clearly and widely as the boy, whose large eyes are unobstructed and clear. The grandfather moves his traditional broom with precision; the father wields a push-broom for increased efficiency. Both argue in front of the timid boy, whose curiosity and sense of wonder eventually lead him to discover joy. #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1418856223375_15005 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_5_1418856223375_15005 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Enrico Casarosa wanted to create a different look from past computer-generated films. “Computers have a way of making things look perfect,” he said, “and we wanted to make it look different.” He wanted to bring the warmth of human imperfections back into his world. He chose to reintroduce handmade textures and color variations by scanning watercolor paintings, then applying them onto the geometry. Every plank on the boat got this treatment. And for the backgrounds, he used watercolor paintings directly as matte to provide a theatrical, handcrafted backdrop."

And in the midst, two umbrellas—one blue, one not—fall eternally in love. Standing out in a crowd, the Blue Umbrella bobs proudly above the rest to shield his owner from the rain. When Blue spots the beautiful and unique Red Umbrella, he does everything in his power to stay by her side. However, when Blue and Red's owners part ways, the city itself comes to life to help bring these two love-struck umbrellas back together. The inspiration for \"The Blue Umbrella\" came from director Saschka Unseld strolling city streets and noticing that even the most inanimate objects had some sort of face or personality. Taking those in, he then crafted a story that literally breathes life into a vibrant city."

      "Sanjay's Super Team SCROLL DOWN Sanjay's Super Team To achieve an otherworldly feeling, director Sanjay Patel asked for the light of the enlightened world to behave differently from the rules of our “normal” world. To make the light of the realm of the deities feel alien, the filmmakers broke many rules of conventional physics, and forced light to behave outside the realm of natural convention. In “Sanjay's Super Team” accomplished artist Sanjay Patel uses his own experience to tell the story of a young, first-generation Indian-American boy whose love for western pop culture comes into conflict with his father’s traditions. Sanjay is absorbed in the world of cartoons and comics, while his father tries to draw him into the traditions of his Hindu practice. Tedium and reluctance quickly turn into an awe-inspiring adventure as the boy embarks on a journey he never imagined, returning with a new perspective that they can both embrace. The deities in Sanjay’s Super Team have been brought to life for thousands of years in India through theater and dance. To capture the movements of the deities Hanuman, Durga, and Vishnu, the filmmakers studied the ancient Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Odissi, and Kathakali. #block-yui_3_17_2_28_1455147551481_43446 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_28_1455147551481_43446 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; }"

      "A Bug's Life Character Design World Design Awards Credits A Bug's Life SCROLL DOWN A Bug's Life Meet Flik. Independent-thinker ant. The only insect capable of throwing a kink in the food chain. After one of Flik's inventions goes terribly wrong, he embarks on a mission to help save the colony from a gang of freeloading grasshoppers in order to get back in good graces with the Queen. But when the group of \"warrior bugs\" that Flik recruits turns out to be a bumbling circus troupe, he must believe in himself and his inventions to save Ant Island once and for all. Trailers The journey of A Bug’s Life started with a huge question: how to follow up Toy Story? Pixar’s wildly successful feature debut had everyone watching the studio’s next move. The filmmakers knew they couldn’t repeat themselves. They needed a story that would inspire them all over again and wanted a story best told in computer animation. They chose to make a wide-screen epic about an incredibly small world. Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Taking off from Aesop’s fable \"The Ant and the Grasshopper,\" A Bug’s Life expanded into the diverse cast of insect characters that became the flea circus. But the filmmakers realized they had too many protagonists to juggle. The story needed a single hero with an empathetic point of view. That’s when the character of Flik got promoted off the anthill. Character Design Voice Casting Flik Everyone keeps telling Flik to stop questioning tradition and be a good worker ant, but he knows that's not his lot in life. Even when the going gets tough, this resourceful but misguided ant risks everything despite some major setbacks and the prevailing perception that he's a failure. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_63673 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_63673 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Princess Atta Princess Atta often seems aggravated, but you would too if you were ascending to the throne and had to deal with a mean freeloading grasshopper.

Flea P.T.'s a blood-sucking proprietor of a run-down insect circus that features some of the lousiest acts in the history of show business.

Wingflaps helped convey the characters' personalities, and Rydstrom found himself mixing the sounds of everything from wet paper towels to World War II airplanes to a real dragonfly they found at Skywalker Ranch, which made “a huge and amazing sound.” Capturing the world from a bug's perspective is no easy task. So Pixar's creative team watched \"bug cam\" footage—shots of flora and fauna from an insect's point of view. They found that a single clover looked like an enormous tree. Cracked mud resembled the Grand Canyon. But most impressive was the translucency of the bug world. When the sun was out and an insect walked on a leaf, its shadow could be seen through the leaf from below. This stained-glass effect inspired the film's vibrant colors. Ant Island Most of A Bug’s Life takes place within a few hundred square feet. The filmmakers got to know the tiny idyllic island “like a live-action set,” said John Lasseter. It was also home to a cast of thousands. The filmmakers had to contend with 400 crowd scenes, ranging from 25 to 1000 ants in each shot. In a first for animated film crowds, each character is unique, fully animated, and clearly acting. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_359484 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_359484 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bug City Flik’s epic adventure had to lead to somewhere exciting, and the perfect contrast to a pastoral island was a city teeming with exotic insects. In a rare acknowledgement of human presence, the Pixar team created a bustling metropolis out of a garbage pile. It’s here that Flik encounters P.T. Flea’s Circus Troupe. According to Co-Director Andrew Stanton, the inspiration for a multinational flea circus “ was the first thing that really felt like us, felt like Pixar. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_374789 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_374789 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Circus Garbage can be useful, particularly when you're trying to think of ideas for a bug-scaled circus. By rifling through trash, the artists transformed everyday objects into a miniature scaled version of a recognizable circus. Egg cartons stacked together looked like a grandstand. A broken umbrella, if painted pink and white, had the exact pattern and shape of a circus tent. A thimble looked big enough to serve as a pedestal for a flea. Prop by prop, a circus came together as if assembled by bugs. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_391488 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_391488 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Hopper's Hideout The filmmakers had always seen Hopper’s herd of marauding grasshoppers as a motorcycle gang. An abandoned sombrero became a south-of-the-border hideout where the gang could party and Hopper could nurse his grudge. When the grasshoppers take to the sky bent on revenge, the sound design included motorcycle engines mixed in with the flapping wings. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_407617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_407617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Vegetation The Pixar team quickly realized that Mother Nature is a terrific artist. Early in the process, Production Designer Bill Cone crawled on his stomach with a camera for a closer look at the vegetation that would become the film’s architecture. Art Director Tia Kratter spent a year painting natural objects. Their efforts came together in “ The Leaf Bridge Test,” a scene that used sophisticated lighting to capture the translucence of a leaf and served as visual inspiration for the film. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_433154 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1472074029488_433154 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscripts A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. There were three ways to think of color in A Bug’s Life, says colorscript creator Bill Cone: What season is it? What time of day is it? And what does the story require—gloom, sunshine, or threatening shadows? From glowing mushrooms and shafts of daylight in the ant’s bunker to the late afternoon lighting scheme for Flik and Atta’s romantic encounters, the colorscript set the tone. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472143512290_37615 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472143512290_37615 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Nominated for Music (Original Musical or Comedy Score): Randy Newman Annie Awards Nominated for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature Nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production John Lasseter & Andrew Stanton Nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Production Design in an Animated Feature Production William Cone Nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Feature Production John Lasseter Andrew Stanton Joe Ranft Don McEnery Bob Shaw Ars Electronica Award of Distinction for Computer Animation / Visual Effects Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Animated Family Movie Broadcast Film Critics Association Winner of Critics' Choice Award for Best Family Film Winner of Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature Casting Society of America Winner of Artois Award for Animated Voice Over Ruth Lambert Hollywood Foreign Press Association Winner of Golden Trailer Award for Best Animation / Family Craig Murray Production Golden Globe Awards Nominated for Best Original Score - Motion Picture Randy Newman Grammy Awards Winner for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Randy Newman, composer Nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media \"The Time of Your Life\" Randy Newman Nominated for Musical Album for Children Nominated for Spoken Word Album for Children International Press Academy Winner of Golden Satellite Award for Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media Los Angeles Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animation John Lasseter Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits DIRECTED BY John Lasseter CO-DIRECTED BY Andrew Stanton PRODUCED BY Darla K.

      "Toy Story 2 Character Design World Design Awards Credits Toy Story 2 SCROLL DOWN Toy Story 2 Buzz, Woody, and their friends are back as Andy heads off to Cowboy Camp, leaving his toys to their own devices. Things shift into high gear when an obsessive toy collector name Al McWhiggin, owner of Al's Toy Barn, kidnaps Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he is a highly valued collectible from a 1950s TV show called \"Woody's Roundup.\" He meets the other prized toys from the show: Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. Andy's toys mount a daring rescue mission, Buzz Lightyear meets his match, and Woody has to decide where he and his heart truly belong. Trailers New Challenges Deciding Toy Story deserved a sequel was easy. Then things got challenging. Disney had green-lit Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video production. An enthused Pixar team got it upgraded to full theatrical release. But when John Lasseter decided the sequel wasn’t yet up to Pixar standards, Disney refused to push back the release date. If Pixar wanted to start over, it had nine months to deliver a finished product, a process that typically took two years. It would test everything Pixar was made of. Sleep Deprevation Lab The Movie Vanishes Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Toy Story 2 reunited an already beloved cast, and new rendering tools literally gave them more texture. The most important new characters, Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete, had to be compelling enough to lure Woody away from Andy. And minor characters posed unexpected challenges. Some had been built quickly for non-emotive roles in Toy Story . “When we brought them back for T oy Story 2 , we looked at the script and said, 'oh jeez, we have to make them run across a conveyor belt, and they don’t have legs that work!',” recalls animator Glenn McQueen. Toy Story 2 marked the third Pixar film in a row to feature a score by Randy Newman. Asked to write a song from a toy’s point of view, Newman responded with “When She Loved Me.” Sung for Jessie by Sarah McLachlan, it earned an Academy Award® Best Song nomination. According to John Lasseter, Jessie’s song was “the most significant change in the movie.” Scoring Jessies Song Woody Of all Andy's toys, Woody seems to be the one who most questions his existence, whether it's as Andy's favorite, a toy destined for the landfill, or a hot collectible. Luckily, Woody comes to his senses before choosing to retire to a museum in Japan. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_41974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_41974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Buzz Lightyear The toy gang's fearless Space Ranger has come down to Earth a bit since his last outing.

Her beloved owner gave her up to charity, she was imprisoned in a dark storage box for years, and now a cowboy from her past is asking her to take risks just when life was starting to get easy. But, Jessie's a toy at heart and would do anything to give joy to a little girl again. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_90921 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_90921 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bullseye This toy horse rides like the wind, especially when it's Woody giving the command. In a 21st-century real-life version of the 1950s TV episode \"Woody's Finest Hour,\" Bullseye must gallop like crazy to rescue Jessie and Woody from a speeding plane. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_110082 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_110082 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mrs. Potato Head Mr. Potato Head®'s \"sweet potato\" lives up to her nickname as an affectionate and lovingly overprotective toy.

When the Prospector's waiting in boxed \"mint condition\" finally pays off, he won't let anything keep him from immortality. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_164429 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_164429 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Emperor Zurg The ultimate force of evil in the galaxy, terrifying tyrant Emperor Zurg is unswerving in his quest to destroy his enemy Buzz Lightyear. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_182974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_182974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Al The shifty proprietor of Al's Toy Barn will do anything to complete his collection of Woody's Roundup toys. His dream of selling his valuable menagerie to a museum nearly comes true when he finds Woody, complete with the elusive hat. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_200422 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_200422 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design While the original stayed fairly close to home, Toy Story 2 chose larger worlds to explore. The filmmakers crafted an elaborate past life for Woody as the hero of a black-and-white TV show, Woody’s Roundup. Buzz Lightyear enjoyed an epic battle on a distant planet. The relative safety of Andy’s neighborhood was abandoned for the daunting adventure of crossing a busy downtown street. Sound Design Al's Apartment Although Al is surrounded by toys, he has a different point of view than Andy. Al is an adult, not a kid, and his only relationship with toys involves a profit motive. The filmmakers established the distance between their worlds by giving Al a small apartment in an imposing high-rise, where the colors were more drab, the lighting was dim and artificial, and air vents would be seen as escape routes. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_233819 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_233819 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Al's Toy Barn For the cast of Toy Story 2 , the trip to Al’s Toy Barn was both perilous and otherworldly. Using only modest exaggeration, the filmmakers presented the retail toy store as towering and awe inspiring, especially when viewed from the very low angle of the characters. It also provided Buzz the existential experience of confronting himself, facing hundreds of identical Buzz Lightyears still in their packages. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_245199 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_245199 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Woody's Roundup A crucial story element involved Woody discovering his past life as a TV star. Delving back to the early days of black-and-white television, the Pixar team envisioned Woody’s Roundup in the primitive marionette format of the day. To capture that authenticity, the crew enlisted various CGI processes to make the vintage television footage look not only old but also like it had been stored in a garage. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_259145 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_259145 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Zurg's Fortress Just as Woody was given a backstory for the sequel, Buzz Lightyear had his own world created for Toy Story 2 . The opening sequence allowed the filmmakers to launch Buzz into a wildly over- matched battle on the distant planet ruled by his archnemesis. The space adventure would be revealed as a video game within the movie, but it established the character of evil Emperor Zurg, who would later pose a real threat to Buzz and friends. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_270784 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_270784 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Airport For Toy Story 2’s dramatic climax, the race led to the Tri-County International Airport. The rescue involved two devices that would be featured in other Pixar films: a Pizza Planet delivery truck and a vast, byzantine world of conveyance systems. In the end, it's Woody’s old-fashioned cowboy heroics that prevail over the modern jetliner. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_289577 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_289577 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscripts A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. Ralph Eggleston set the visual style for Toy Story with his original colorscript. Production Designer Bill Cone expanded on it for Toy Story 2. “ It’s writing a symphony where the dynamics of the plot are reflected in the dynamics of light and color,” offers Cone. “ The expression of light and color in storytelling is a bottomless well of inquiry. You won’t run out of ways to express mood and emotion through those qualities. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_305678 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1472074029488_305678 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Nominated for Music (Original Musical or Comedy Score) Randy Newman \"When She Loved Me\" Annie Awards Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production John Lasseter Lee UnkricH Ash Brannon Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Music in an Animated Feature Production Randy Newman Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production Dan Jeup & Joe Ranft Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Feature Production Joan Cusack Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production Tim Allen Winner for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Feature Production John Lasseter Pete Docter Ash Brannon Andrew Stanton Rita Hsiao Doug Chamberlain Chris Webb Nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation Doug Sweetland Nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Production Design in an Animated Feature Production William Cone & Jim Pearson Broadcast Film Critics Association Winner of Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature Camie Awards, Inc.

      "Monsters Inc. Character Design World Design Awards Credits Monsters Inc. SCROLL DOWN Monsters Inc. There's a reason why there are monsters in children's closets—it's their job. Monsters, Inc. is the most successful scream-processing factory in the monster world, and there is no better Scarer than James P. Sullivan. But when \"Sulley\" accidentally lets a little human girl into Monstropolis, life turns upside down for him and his buddy Mike. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Finding Boo Having given monsters James P. “Sulley” Sullivan and Mike Wazowski the most prestigious job in Monstropolis—Scarer—the filmmakers needed to find the right kid to scare. The character of Boo only emerged after several story changes. “Ultimately we needed the kid to be as cute and appealing as it gets, and we decided it’s hard to beat a two-year-old girl for that,” explains Director Pete Docter. Story Is King Fur Characters Animation Story Pitch James P. “Sulley” Sullivan James P. “Sulley” Sullivan may be the most celebrated Scarer in Monstropolis, but that doesn't make him mean. When the softhearted monster has to care for Boo, he discovers that love and laughter are more powerful than making kids scream. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_50583 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_50583 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mike Wazowski Sulley's scare assistant, best friend, and roommate doesn't want any interruptions in his life—especially in his relationships. Although Mike thinks Boo is a \"killing machine\" at first, he later finds she's a great audience for his natural comedic talent. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_77617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_77617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Boo Boo has a vocabulary of about three words, but that doesn't stop this curious human girl from stealing Sulley's heart and overcoming her fear of Randall. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_97066 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_97066 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Randall Boggs Able to scare even his co-workers with his chameleon abilities, Randall is one of the most wicked monsters in Monstropolis. His plan to capture the all-time scare record only scratches the surface of his sinister agenda. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_122901 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_122901 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Henry J. Waternoose III Monsters, Inc. has been in the Waternoose family for generations, and Henry J. Waternoose III will do anything to beat the scream shortage and make his company profitable again. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_141245 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1470761183310_141245 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Roz Dispatch Manager Roz may be slow moving and slow talking, but the quick-witted slug has her eye on everything—including Mike Wazowski’s lack of paperwork. She's a No. 1 nut in Mike's book and a No. 1 boss to others. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762098874_53117 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762098874_53117 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Celia The factory's one-eyed, snake-haired receptionist must put her birthday celebration on hold as she gets caught in the middle of Sulley and Mike's crazy predicament.

But monsters did not lend themselves to scrutiny. A trip to the public library was largely unproductive. Interviews with kids revealed that while they believed in monsters, they were hazy on the details. The filmmakers finally decided to unleash artists and illustrators to create monsters from their own imagination. “Given the choice between serious study and making it up….we decided to just make it up,” says Pete Docter. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_76100 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_76100 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Child Detection Agency Saving Monstropolis from human contamination is no small task. Clad in yellow suits, the highly trained Child Detection Agency (CDA) teams work around the clock eliminating wayward human goods and disinfecting hapless monsters. Nothing gets past these guys—not even a sock. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_101750 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_101750 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Door As most kids know, a closet door is one of the few things capable of keeping monsters at bay. With this simple dividing line, the Pixar team created worlds for both sides of the door. Each side had its own rules, the most important of which was forbidding anything from the human world to cross into the monster world. Filmmakers Roundtable The City The Apartment To successfully create a believable world in which monsters live, work, dine, and date, each individual prop and element of architecture had to be part of the whole approach for Monstropolis. The world needed to echo the human world and yet be monster specific. Details of Mike and Sulley’s apartment, one of the first sets to be developed, exemplified the depth of the thought process that played a part during the design stage of production. Brick buildings reinforced with steel, like those from the 1900s, felt like they could support monsters who weighed as much as 800 pounds. Household appliances ran on scream energy instead of electricity—so everything like the TV, stereo, and lighting hooked up to conduits that suggested a supply source similar to natural gas. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_144628 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_144628 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Boo's Room For Boo’s room, Pixar artists strove to create a little girl’s room that was both appealing and inviting. The room reflected her personality and creativity; an easel stood in the corner, her artwork covered the walls, and evidence of interrupted pretend-games were strewn on the floor. It needed to feel personal, but also a bit idealized, to work with the story point that her room resembled a simulator room in the scream factory. Meticulous care went into choosing every detail of the door that needed to be distinguishable from every other door in existence. The curves of the outlined contours, the shapes and placement of the flowers, and color choices were all intentional and deliberate. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_171177 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_171177 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Factory The factory took its shape inspired by images of post-World War II America and the dawn of the baby boom. The filmmakers decided Monsters, Inc. would have expanded heavily during this golden age of children to frighten. Then with the advent of violent films, television, and video games, the expansion would have stopped, leaving the Monsters, Inc. factory with its vintage assembly line and architectural design. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_191375 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_191375 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Monstropolis When the Pixar team set out to create a city of monsters, the possibilities were limitless. But they soon decided Monstropolis made more sense with a few facts: (1) Monsters have been around for as long as there have been frightened humans. The city should reflect this long history. (2) Monsters come in all shapes. Doors, telephones, and lockers must be usable by two-foot-tall monsters with tentacles as well as eleven-foot monsters with claws. (3) Most monsters are very heavy. The city would be built with strong, durable materials like brick, stone, and steel. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_210480 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_210480 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscripts A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. For Monsters, Inc., Production Designer Harley Jessup teamed with Art Director Dominique Louis and Lighting Director Jean-Claude Kalache to explore the visual contradictions between a drab, workaday industrial town setting and its population of bright, candy-colored monsters straight out of a child’s imagination. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_229927 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470762301004_229927 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards 2001 Winner for Best Music (Original Song) \"If I Didn't Have You\" - Randy Newman Winner for Sound Editing Gary Rydstrom Michael Silver Nominated for Best Animated Feature Film Pete Docter John Lasseter Nominated for Best Music (Original Score) Randy Newman AC Nielsen EDI 2001 Gold Reel Recognition Pete Docter Annie Awards 2002 Winner for Outstanding Character Animation Doug Sweetland Nominated for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature Nominated for Outstanding Character Animation John Kahrs Nominated for Outstanding Character Design in an Animated Feature Production Ricky Nierva Nominated for Outstanding Directing in an Animated Feature Production Pete Docter Lee Unkrich David Silverman Nominated for Outstanding Music in an Animated Feature Production Randy Newman Nominated for Outstanding Production Design in an Animated Feature Production Harley Jessup Nominated for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Feature Production Andrew Stanton Daniel Garson Ars Electronica 2001 Awarded Golden Nica Andrew Stanton Lee Unkrich Pete Docter, David Silverman The British Academy of Film and Television Arts 2001-2002 Winner for Children's - Feature Film Darla K.

      "Finding Nemo Character Design World Design Awards Credits Finding Nemo SCROLL DOWN Finding Nemo In the colorful and warm tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef, a Clown Fish named Marlin lives safe and secluded in his anemone home with his only son, Nemo. Fearful of the ocean and its unpredictable risks, he struggles to protect his son. Nemo, like all young fish, is eager to explore the mysterious reef. When Nemo is unexpectedly taken far from home and thrust into a tacky dentist’s office fish tank, Marlin finds himself the unlikely hero on an epic journey to rescue his son. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Classic Characters In Finding Nemo the supporting characters drew inspiration from classic movies: Gil was given Clint Eastwood’s squint, Bloat was based on George Kennedy’s character in Cool Hand Luke, and the Tank Gang borrowed the neuroses of the characters in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Characters Story The Whale Anemone Nemo Nemo is a curious and impressionable six-year-old, only child who lives with his overprotective, single-parent father, Marlin. Having led a sheltered life, Nemo brims with the excitement of starting school and finally seeing the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. Despite being born with a withered fin, Nemo yearns for adventure, and as fate takes him far from home, he learns he is capable of doing great things. #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_50036 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_50036 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Marlin Sheltered deep within The Great Barrier reef, safe inside his anemone home, lives Marlin. After losing his wife and family to the ocean, Marlin is left alone to raise his only surviving child, Nemo. He vows never to let anything happen to his son. A loving and responsible father, Marlin keeps his noble promise throughout Nemo’s early years. However, Marlin’s fear and distrust of the sea builds, and he struggles with his inability to let go of Nemo as his son begins school. When Nemo is suddenly taken away, Marlin must try to find in himself the courage, wisdom, and faith needed to search the unpredictable ocean to bring his boy home – the very characteristics he needs to allow his son to learn and grow. #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_68343 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_68343 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dory Throughout the vast ocean you will not find a fish more hospitable, more friendly, or more sociable than Dory. She would love to chat with you all day and tell you her life story, but she can’t. Dory suffers from short term memory loss. Dory is the aquatic Good Samaritan who offers to help Marlin on his journey to find his son. She is certainly an odd partner for such a quest, but her optimism proves an invaluable quality to help Marlin overcome the impossible. To Dory, the glass is always half-full. #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_101215 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1470688592667_101215 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Gill Gill is the maverick of the dentist’s office fish tank. He is the leader of an eclectic gang of fish, who hang on his every word and are drawn to his magnetic personality. This tough, scarred, one-finned fish was raised in the ocean, but taken at a young age to live in a tank. Surrounded by fish who have spent their entire lives in “the box,” Gill alone feels the pull to be free. Though he dreams of one day breaking out and returning to the ocean, his failed escape attempts have broken his spirit. With Nemo's arrival to the tank, Gill is inspired again to find a way back to the sea. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_54192 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_54192 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Tank Gang No matter where you're from—the ocean, eBay, Pet Palace, or mail order—being stuck in a kitschy dentist's aquarium can do things to a fish. Led by escape artist Gill, Peach, Bloat, Gurgle, Deb, Bubbles, and Jacques make life livable with tiki-inspired tank rituals, all the while dreaming of getting back into the Big Blue. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_75423 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_75423 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sharks Bruce, Anchor and Chum are mates. Anchor is cynical; he hates dolphins. Chum is hyperactive; he can’t keep still. Bruce is the jolly leader of the pack. All three are members of a Fish-Eaters Anonymous Group, and are tormented by their natural urge to eat fish and their resulting unpopularity amongst the general ocean population. Consequently, they have embraced a “veggie” lifestyle, allegedly swearing off fish, and living off politically correct kelp instead. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_125826 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_125826 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Turtles Crush and his offspring Squirt know how to chill and go with the flow, especially the one created by the East Australian Current. The two have a righteous bond that's totally sweet. After 150 years of living in the ocean, Crush knows a thing or two about being a good parent. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_143169 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_143169 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Nigel Nigel is a tough old local bird. He likes to hang out on the docks with his other pelican mates and carry on. But Nigel has a guilty pleasure the others don’t know about; he loves to sneak off and spend hours in the dentist office window, diagnosing dental problems with his fish friends in the tank. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_162540 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_162540 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mr. Ray's Class This school of young, impressionable fish love their tuneful teacher's marine-inspired songs and impromptu oceanography lessons. Riding atop Mr. Ray like an underwater magic carpet, the kids experience the ocean through the eyes of a scientist and true deep sea explorer. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_180290 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_180290 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dentist/Darla Don't be angry with the dentist for taking Nemo—from his point of view, he was rescuing a struggling fish destined to be eaten. The dentist's niece Darla, on the other hand, can't seem to shake her habit of shaking the bags containing her fishy gifts. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_208090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470759975133_208090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Coral Proud mother-to-be Coral is a freethinker who opts for the more creative name of \"Nemo\" for one of her babies. Coral provides strength and optimism in her relationship with Marlin and is the first to believe in him when he doubts his parenting skills. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_53409 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_53409 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Fish Eye View \"I grew up in Massachusetts, by the sea, and I remember going to my family dentist, who had this funky fish tank in his office. All kids are attracted to aquariums, and I remember staring at this tank and thinking what a weird view of the world this must be for the fish—it’s like flying into Las Vegas and that’s your first view of America,\" recalls writer-director Andrew Stanton. Animation Set Dressing Colorscripts Shading Effects The Tank Intended to amuse children visiting the dentist’s office, the fish tank in Finding Nemo can also be viewed as a glass prison for its unlucky inhabitants. Looking to illustrate the odd dichotomy, the filmmakers found inspiration in the world of kitsch aquarium accessories and began filling the tank with garish plastic objects. When we meet them, we find the tank gang has gone slightly mad, prisoners not only of their narrow confines but also the dentist’s bad taste. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_99726 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_99726 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Current It’s not often that an ocean current plays a role in a movie, but the real-life East Australian Current (EAC) had compelling qualities. A colorful underwater highway favored by migrating fish and sea turtles, the EAC follows a path of hundreds of miles before reaching Sydney Harbor, providing a handy template for both the Pixar art and story teams. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_127807 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_127807 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Drop Off The epic journey required Marlin to leave the relative safety of his home on the coral reef for the depths of the great unknown, which the filmmakers viewed as both a metaphor and the very real drop-off of a deep-ocean trench. “ The ocean is so beautiful and there’s so much to explore, but if you’re a fish, every foot you go there is something that could eat you,\" observed producer Graham Walters. “ Ultimately it comes down to anything could be out there. It’s both wondrous and terrifying. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_153306 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760515377_153306 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Harbor Humans enter the picture as Marlin and Dory reach Sydney Harbor, bustling with trawling fishermen, a sewage treatment plant, views of iconic Sydney landmarks, and most importantly, buildings perched next to the water. For both scenic and technical reasons, the filmmakers needed their land-based scenes as close to the ocean as possible, and a dentist’s office in the charming seaside community of North Sydney provided the perfect location for Nemo’s final rescue. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_47957 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_47957 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Jellyfish How do you construct a set out of thousands of gelatinous, translucent animals? “ We spent a lot of time with Ralph’s (Eggelston) pastels, watched a lot of underwater footage taken in Palau in the South Pacific, and also went to visit the jellyfish exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium to better understand what jellyfish look like and how they really move,” explains Supervising Technical Director Oren Jacob. “ In the end this is one of the most beautiful scenes in the movie, and one of the scariest, too. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_66373 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_66373 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Reef With Nemo’s home set in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the Pixar team had one of the most colorful environments on Earth to work with. The unlikely challenge was how much to change its otherworldly beauty. Early R&D tests were startling. “It looked so real!” recalls John Lasseter. “From that first CG coral reef test we realized we had to go further with stylization than we’d ever gone before. Of course we have talking fish, but we really needed the audience to know that this world, while believable, was also make-believe. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_91633 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_91633 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Whale \"Inside the whale it’s dark, and in a dark environment, the lighting requires extreme precision. There’s no obvious light source, so we had to create something. Whales have a baleen—a thick, broom-like substance around their lips—so we have the light seeping through there,\" explains Director of Photography for Lighting Sharon Calahan. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470761183310_50189 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470761183310_50189 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Sunken Ship The filmmakers wanted a chase scene involving Dory, Marlin, and great white shark Bruce. Many scenarios were being considered when a team field trip to a submarine docked at a San Francisco pier revealed that submarine floors are actually grates. With that simple fact in mind, the Pixar team envisioned a wild escape sequence set in the wreck of an old World War II era submarine sunk in the Great Barrier Reef. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_115884 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_115884 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscript A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. For Finding Nemo, Production Designer Ralph Eggleston started with the vibrant palette of the underwater reef, among the most naturally colorful environments on Earth, then shifted to an increasingly minimalist and ominous palette as Marlin and Dory descend into the murky depths of the ocean on an increasingly perilous journey. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_134372 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470760839178_134372 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards AC Nielsen EDI Winner of Gold Reel in Recognition of Extraordinary Box Office Achievement Surpassing $100 Million Andrew Stanton Academy Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Film Andrew Stanton Nominated for Music (Original Screenplay) Thomas Newman Nominated for Writing (Original Screenplay) Screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, David Reynolds; Original Story by Andrew Stanton Nominated for Sound Editing Gary Rydstrom, Michael Silvers Annie Awards Winner for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature Winner for Outstanding Music in an Animated Feature Production: Thomas Newman Winner for Outstanding Production Design in an Animated Feature Production Ralph Eggleston Winner for Outstanding Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production Ellen DeGeneres Winner for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Feature Production Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson & David Reynolds Winner for Outstanding Character Design in an Animated Feature Production Ricky Nierva Winner for Outstanding Character Animation Doug Sweetland Winner for Outstanding Effects Animation Martin Nguyen Winner for Outstanding Directing in an Animated Feature Production Andrew Stanton & Lee Unkrich Nominated for Outstanding Character Animation David Devan Nominated for Outstanding Character Animation Gini Santos Nominated for Outstanding Effects Animation Justin Paul Ritte The ConFurence Group Winner of Ursa Major Award for Best Anthropomorphic Motion Picture Golden Globe Awards Nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy The Human Society of the United States Winner of Genesis Award for Outstanding Animated Feature Film Andrew Stanton, Lee Unkrich International 3D Awards Winner of Digital Hero Award for Best 3D Animated Feature Film Motion Picture Sound Editors Winner of Golden Reel for Best Sound Editing in Animated Features - Music: Bill Bernstein National Board of Review Winner for Best Animated Feature Andrew Stanton Lee Unkrich Graham Walters Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Winner for Favorite Movie Winner for Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie Ellen DeGeneres Rotten Tomatoes Fresh Pick of the Year 2003 ShoWest Awarded Animation Director of the Year Andrew Stanton SPACE: The Imagination Station Winner of Spacey Award for Best Animated Movie Video Business DVD Exclusive Awards Winner for Best Games and Interactive Bill Kinder; David Jassen Winner for Best Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and Bloopers: Bill Kinder Andrew Stanton Roger Gould Winner for Best Menu Design Bill Kinder; David Jessen Visual Effects Society Winner for Outstanding Character Animation in an Animated Motion Picture Andrew Gordon Brett Coderre Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits DIRECTED BY Andrew Stanton CO-DIRECTED BY Lee Unkrich PRODUCED BY Graham Walters EXECUTIVE PRODUCED BY John Lasseter ASSOCIATE PRODUCER Jinko Gotoh ORIGINAL STORY BY Andrew Stanton SCREENPLAY BY Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, David Reynolds MUSIC BY Thomas Newman STORY SUPERVISORS Ronnie del Carmen, Dan Jeup, Jason Katz FILM EDITOR David Ian Salter SUPERVISING TECHNICAL DIRECTOR Oren Jacob PRODUCTION DESIGNER Ralph Eggleston DIRECTORS OF PHOTOGRAPHY Sharon Calahan, Jeremy Lasky SUPERVISING ANIMATOR Dylan Brown CHARACTER ART DIRECTOR Ricky Vega Nierva SHADING ART DIRECTOR Robin Cooper ENVIRONMENT ART DIRECTOR Anthony Christov, Randy Berrett CHARACTERS CG SUPERVISOR Brian Green OCEAN UNIT CG SUPERVISORS Lisa Forssell, Danielle Feinberg REEF UNIT CG SUPERVISOR David Eisenmann TANK UNIT CG SUPERVISOR Jesse Hollander SHARKS/SYDNEY UNIT CG SUPERVISOR Steve May GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY CG SUPERVISOR Michael Fong DIGITAL FINAL CG SUPERVISOR Anthony Apodaca SCHOOLING/FLOCKING CG SUPERVISOR Michael Lorenzen PRODUCTION MANAGER Lindsey Collins SOUND DESIGN Gary Rydstrom CASTING Mary Hidalgo, Kevin Reher, Matthew Jon Beck CAST Marlin Albert Brooks Dory Ellen DeGeneres Nemo Alexander Gould Gill Willem Dafoe Bloat Brad Garrett Peach Allison Janney Gurgle Austin Pendleton Bubbles Stephen Root Deb (& Flo) Vicki Lewis Jacques Joe Ranft Nigel Geoffrey Rush Crush Andrew Stanton Coral Elizabeth Perkins Squirt Nicholas Bird Mr. Ray Bob Peterson Bruce Barry Humphries Anchor Eric Bana Chum Bruce Spence Dentist Bill Hunter Darla LuLu Ebeling Tad Jordy Ranft Pearl Erica Beck Sheldon Erik Per Sullivan Fish School John Ratzenberger"

      "The Incredibles Character Design World Design Awards Credits The Incredibles SCROLL DOWN The Incredibles It takes a will of steel to hide your superhero talents from a world that still needs you, yet no longer appreciates what you can do. Battling a bulging belly and a boring job, Mr. Incredible longs for the glory days of upholding law and order while his superhuman family tries to fit in with their \"normal\" life. Relief from quiet suburbia finally comes years later, when the family uncovers a diabolical plan and must bring together their respective strengths to save the day. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Superpowers The Parr family's superpowers were based on their personalities. As a dad, Bob had to be the strong one, and mom Helen had to handle being pulled in all directions. Violet, the insecure teen, doesn’t want people to look at her, while Dash represents a typical hyperactive boy. And baby Jack-Jack is all about undiscovered potential. E-volution Characters Building Humans Animation Story Mr. Incredible Once the best-known, most popular superhero alive, Bob Parr is now fifteen years older and is bolder and heavier. As a claims adjuster at possibly the world’s worst insurance company, Insuricare, the former Mr. Incredible’s heroics are limited to helping people navigate the intricacies of the appeals system. Bob’s unhappiness has taken a toll and he and his family have become disconnected. Bob thinks the best years of his life are in the past, but what he will discover is that his family is his greatest adventure. #block-yui_3_17_2_32_1469747525679_58317 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_32_1469747525679_58317 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Elastigirl Helen Parr, the former super-stretching superhero, has adjusted to normal life quite well, and is busily focused on caring for her three children. While she occasionally uses her amazing ability to stretch to meet the daily challenges of modern motherhood, she is careful to do so only behind the closed doors of their suburban home. She misses the old days, but doesn’t dwell on those times as she has a wonderful family and is quite happy to spend her time with them. She only wishes Bob would do the same. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_50375 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_50375 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dash At age ten, Dash seems to be moving even when standing still. Full of restless energy, he has the power of super-speed – a power so useful for playing pranks that he has difficulty keeping it in check. Dash doesn’t understand why superheroes should hide their powers – why would they have them if they weren’t supposed to use them? #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_107171 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_107171 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Violet Violet Parr is, in many ways, a typical shy, insecure teenage girl stuck at the crossroads between child and woman. She, like her parents and brother Dash, has special powers, and it seems only right that hers allow her to turn invisible and protect herself with a secure force field. For what would be better for an awkward young woman but to be able to disappear from her problems at a moments notice? Especially for someone who desperately wants to be like everybody else, normal, but truly isn’t. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_164447 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_164447 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Syndrome Syndrome wasn’t born with superpowers, but envied the attention and admiration the Supers received. Of all the Supers, Mr. Incredible embodied everything Syndrome desired: strength, fame, and popularity. Highly intelligent and cunning, Syndrome now spends his days on a remote island on the other side of the world inventing gadgets and robots to carry out a diabolical plot. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_200592 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_200592 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Edna \"E\" Mode Brilliant and successful, Edna Mode got her start in the industry as the world’s leading superhero costume designer. With her now-mature sense of design, she remains the top designer in the field, taking her clothing designs to Milan, Paris and other internationally important fashion centers. However, E longs for the return of the superheroes, for a real design challenge, so she can fuse the latest technology with her impeccable fashion sense and unfurl her incredible creations for the adoring public. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_236183 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_236183 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Jack-Jack Jack-Jack is the black sheep of the family. He is nearly two years old, and it seems the only thing incredible that he can do is jabber in gibberish. He’s very good at that— as well as throwing food at dinnertime. Hey, that’s what being a baby is all about! But who knows, maybe someday … He is an Incredible after all … #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470761183310_52889 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470761183310_52889 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Frozone Lucius Best used to be known as the coolest superhero on the planet – and not just because he was best friends with Mr. Incredible. His style, wit and attitude made Frozone, as he was known then, the hippest of the lot. Of course his powers made him cool too, literally. Lucius’ ability to create ice from moisture in the air, and then travel on it with his special boots, made him the envy of every gadget-loving little boy. Lucius knows the old days are done and there’s no going back, so he doesn’t try to relive the past. But he knows Bob still wants to, and he tries to help him adjust in any way he can. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_348400 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_348400 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mirage Syndrome's mysterious love interest might be drawn to power, but she quickly learns the consequences when power is in the wrong hands. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_365353 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_365353 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Omnidroid The ultimate robot in the Omnidroid family, the Omnidroid 1000 was custom designed by Syndrome to defeat Mr. Incredible. The only problem: Omnidroid has a mind of its own. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_387016 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_387016 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Gilbert Huph Patrolling the cubicles of Insuricare, it’s Gilbert Huph’s job to make work as drab and unfulfilling as possible, especially when an underling like Bob Parr towers over him. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_401640 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_401640 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Future The world of The Incredibles evokes the future as imagined in the early 1960s. Pixar designers found inspiration in television shows like Jonny Quest, the early James Bond pictures, and Walt Disney’s original Tomorrowland. Set Design Lighting Building Extras The Sound Of The Incredibles Filled with a fantastic array of futuristic gadgets, devices, and vehicles, The Incredibles required the Pixar team to come up with sounds for things that never existed. One sequence featured Dash being chased by Velocipads. \"No one knew how a Velocipad should sound,\" recalls sound designer Randy Thom, “ but they had to sound dangerous.” Adds Thom, “I had to fabricate more new sounds for The Incredibles than any other film I’ve ever worked on. ” Sound New Family Pixar had already established itself with a string of innovative and successful films when John Lasseter decided to add new blood. Brad Bird had already created the highly regarded Iron Giant when he came on board, bringing with him an idea about a family of superheroes. For the film that would become The Incredibles, the team enlisted prolific composer Michael Giacchino, who became another valued member of the Pixar family. The Parr Home Adhering to the early 1960s theme, the Parr home is a study in mid-century architecture with some odd futuristic twists, like the washing machine with a clear plastic dome, and a TV that mashes a contemporary wide screen with a vintage console. Though the house is comfortable in most respects, the filmmakers still needed it to suggest that it was an imperfect fit for the extraordinary family. As technical director Rick Sayre puts it, “Bob is a superhero stuck in his own suburban fortress of solitude.” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_442210 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_442210 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Nomanisan Crafting a supervillain’s lair gave the creative team a broader canvas to work with. At first glance it had to be an island paradise, then little by little reveal its sinister aspects. “ Each character sees the island from their own perspective, ” explains Story Supervisor Mark Andrews. “ Bob uses his strength and knocks out a guard with a coconut. Helen sees the island in a more stealthy way. For the kids, who haven’t been allowed to use their superpowers, the island is a trial by fire, particularly with Dash being chased and having to finally use his super speed.\" #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_461397 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_461397 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } E's Lair \"When we started to design E’s house we knew we wanted it to be very modern and minimalist,\" says Production Designer Lou Romano. \"But we also wanted to incorporate superhero elements as well that would tie in with E’s past work as a hero costume designer. We went to Greek mythology and art for inspiration and specifically focused on anything to do with gods and heroes – the true superheroes of that time.

Lou Romano created his colorscript for The Incredibles with the 1960s sensibilities that infused the rest of the film. Romano’s technique was to “ create these shapes that basically told the story in color,” says Character Designer Teddy Newton. “ I really took a lot of inspiration from these colorscripts. ” The filmmakers paid homage to Romano’s “ basic shapes ” in crafting the kinetic 2D end credit sequence. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_496222 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469828901382_496222 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards 2004 Winner for Animated Feature Film Brad Bird Winner for Sound Editing Michael Silvers Randy Thom Nominated for Sound Mixing Randy Thom Gary A.

      "Cars Character Design World Design Awards Credits Cars SCROLL DOWN Cars Aspiring champion race car Lightning McQueen is on the fast track to success, fame, and everything he's ever hoped for—until he takes an unexpected detour on dusty Route 66. His have-it-all-now attitude is thrown into a tailspin when a small-town community that time forgot shows McQueen what he's been missing in his high-octane life. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Cars as Characters The filmmakers wanted the cars to look and feel authentic, so that the audience would relate to them as characters. A hotshot racecar was the early choice for lead character Lightning McQueen, and a rusty real-life tow truck found off Route 66 came to life as Mater. The Pixar team chose other cars to reflect people they had met on the road during their research for the film. Hudson Hornet Animation and Acting McQueen Has No Hands Lightning McQueen Lightning McQueen is a hotshot, rookie race car, poised to become the youngest car ever to win the Piston Cup Championship. He has just two things on his mind: winning and the perks that come with it. But when he in-advertently gets lost in the town of Radiator Springs, he meets a new group of friends who challenge him to reconsider the car he wants to be. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1470951819488_47042 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1470951819488_47042 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mater Mater is a good ol' boy tow truck with a big heart and a lovable laugh to match. Though a little rusty, he has the quickest towrope in Carburetor County and is always the first to lend a helping hand. He's the sweetest, most loyal guy in town and the first to befriend newcomer Lightning McQueen. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_46821 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_46821 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sally Sally is a beautiful 2002 Porsche 911 from California who grew tired of life in the fast lane and made a new start in the small town of Radiator Springs. Charming, intelligent, and witty, she is the town's attorney and the car most dedicated to one day getting Radiator Springs \"back on the map.\" #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_64121 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_64121 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Doc Hudson Doc Hudson is a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a quiet country doctor with a mysterious past. A cornerstone of Radiator Springs, Doc runs the local medical clinic and serves as the town judge. But when Lightning McQueen rolls through town, Doc's old competitive engine gets revved up once more. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_84597 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_84597 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Luigi & Guido Luigi is a 1959 Fiat 500 who runs the local tire shop, Luigi's Casa Della Tires. Big-hearted, gregarious and excitable Luigi is assisted by Guido, a little Italian forklift, and together they serve up more than a new set of wheels for customers. Their positive energy and enthusiasm have a natural way of rubbing off on anyone who passes through their shop doors. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_101864 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_101864 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Fillmore Fillmore is a 1960 VW Bus and Radiator Springs' resident hippie.

As Radiator Springs' resident peacekeeper, he takes his job very seriously. Between his law enforcement duties and the stories he tells about his beloved Mother Road, it is no surprise that Sheriff can often be found napping behind the Radiator Springs billboard. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_138762 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_138762 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sarge Sarge is a 1942 Willys Army Jeep and a patriotic veteran to the core. He proudly flies the Stars and Stripes and begins each day with a rousing rendition of reveille. When he's not running Sarge's Surplus Hut, he can be found precisely manicuring the lawn in front of his Quonset garage into a perfect flattop. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_157612 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_157612 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Ramone Ramone is a 1959 Impala low-rider and the owner and proprietor of Ramone's House of Body Art, the local custom body and paint shop.

Fast-track motor speedways would provide some of the pavement, but the story needed a sleepier locale. The filmmakers found it on Route 66, the fabled highway where American car culture took off in the 1950s. When the highway was replaced by the federal interstate system, hundreds of towns virtually fell off the map. Radiator Springs Graphics Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour Real World Racing Radiator Springs Memorable research trips along Route 66 led the Pixar team to create the town of Radiator Springs in a high desert setting somewhere between Gallup, New Mexico, and Kingman, Arizona, where towns of broken neon, peeling paint, and colorful denizens still exist. “ We connected with the people and their towns and we really got it, ” Co-Director and Story Supervisor Joe Ranft observed. “ We found out that life out on that old highway is never predictable, and that is what makes the journey so much more memorable. We found the heartbeat of the Mother Road. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_225441 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_225441 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Landscapes It took three days to prepare the first drawings that would define the Cars landscape. Working from an early inspiration board of automobile and desert references, Production Designer Bill Cone came up with an idea; he spent the day, and that night, thinking of how it could work. Then he rendered several sketches to illustrate his concept that cars, like humans, would shape the world around them as monuments that echoed their likeness. That happened back in 2000, and twelve years later, the landscape became real for generations to visit at Disney’s California Adventure. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_240640 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_240640 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Racing The filmmakers knew no one would watch Cars with a keener eye than professional racing fans. Stock car legend Richard Petty was brought in to provide authenticity, then stayed around to provide voiceover for the 1970 Plymouth Superbird that shared his nickname “The King.” Pixar teams also took extended field trips to some of America’s biggest speedways, looking to capture the sensory overload of rumbling engines, blinding floodlights, and the smell of exhaust, burning rubber, and tailgate barbecue. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_256232 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_256232 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Graphics Graphics are not just creations made with words, names, numbers, letters, colors, and typeface—they are opportunities to include hidden stories. The world of Cars called for an unprecedented number of original graphics, split into three major categories: hometown, broadcast news, and stock car racing. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_269123 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_269123 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Research According to John Lasseter, more research went into Cars than any other project at Pixar to date. Field trips ranged from leisurely journeys across Route 66 to the fast lane of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, where a couple of infield fans named Larry and Mater would charm their way into the film. A Pixar team also traveled to the automotive mecca of Detroit to see how cars are designed and assembled from the ground up. Pixar artists used thousands of still photos and hours of car footage to give Cars the level of detail it would need on the big screen. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_283826 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_283826 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscript A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. A car lost on a lonely road. A racer outcast within a packed stadium. Many key emotional scenes of Cars took place at night. Creating the paintings to define the lighting provided an interesting challenge. “ Light is fictional at night, ” explained Production Designer Bill Cone. Light sources that could illuminate the scene had to be invented and manipulated just enough to allow the audience to see what was important, and yet still produce colors that stayed true to a scene's mood. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_294427 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470951952004_294427 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Nominated for Animated Feature Film John Lasseter Nominated for Music (Original Score) \"Our Town\" - Randy Newman Annie Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Winner for Best Music in an Animated Feature Production Randy Newman Nominated for Best Animated Effects Keith Klohn Erdem Hamsi Taylan Nominated for Best Character Animation in a Feature Production Carlos Baena Bobby Podesta Nominated for Best Directing in an Animated Feature Production John Lasseter Nominated for Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production William Cone Nominated for Best Writing in an Animated Feature Production Dan Fogelman Broadcast Film Critics Association Winner of Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature Golden Globe Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Film Grammys Winner for Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media \"Our Town\" Randy Newman, composer Hollywood Film Festival Winner for Animation of the Year Motion Picture Sound Editors Winner for Best Sound Editing Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue and ADR for Feature Film Animation Tom Myers Michael Silvers Jonathan Null Bruno Coon Teresa Eckton Shannon Mills Dee Selby Steve Slanec Christopher Barrick Jana Vance Dennie Thorpe Ellen Heuer Movie Guide Winner for Best Family Film National Board of Review Winner for Best Animated Feature People's Choice Winner for Favorite Family Movie Winner for Favorite Song from a Movie Life is a Highway, Rascal Flatts Winner for Favorite Remake Life is a Highway, Rascal Flatts Producers Guild of America Winner of Producer of the Year Award: Animated Theatrical Motion Picture Darla K.

      "Ratatouille Character Design World Design Awards Credits Ratatouille SCROLL DOWN Ratatouille A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great chef despite his family's wishes, and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the world of Paris upside down. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Artist Rat \"Remy’s dilemma is basically the same as any artist’s. In many countries, certainly this one, art is considered extra, something you do after real work is over. The idea of doing it for a living is widely considered impractical at best. But for our rat Remy, art—experiencing it, trying to create it—is one of the biggest reasons there is to get up in the morning.\" -Writer/Director Brad Bird. Collete Linguini Remy Remy Rats are no strangers to rejection, but Remy, a rat who longs to be a great chef, has more than the usual obstacles to overcome. His remarkable sense of smell and genius for combining flavors puts him head and shoulders above most human chefs. However, in the rat world he ’ s resigned to a life of being the “ poison sniffer, ” using his unique talent to pick out the safe garbage for his family to eat. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_44806 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_44806 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Auguste Gusteau The late Auguste Gusteau, France ’ s all-time greatest culinary genius, is the author of Anyone Can Cook, the cookbook that inspires Remy's dream of becoming a chef. Gusteau's Paris restaurant became a landmark on the strength of his imaginative vision and masterful preparation, which simultaneously honored and played with the traditions of French cuisine. Gusteau died mysteriously soon after his restaurant was downgraded from five stars to four (by food critic Anton Ego), but his spirit lives on in his recipes and Remy ’ s imagination—the great chef is a recurring figure as Remy ’ s imaginary soul mate and counselor. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470762949117_41596 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470762949117_41596 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Linguini Linguini, a timid and well-meaning young man, is the new garbage boy at Gusteau’s. After a series of ill-fated jobs, Linguini is desperate to hold onto this one, which he sees as his last hope. A chance encounter with Remy thrusts Linguini into a highly unusual “ghost-cooking” relationship, in which he provides the gangly brawn for Remy’s culinary brains. As Remy’s food attracts more and more attention, the pair is subject to increasingly intense scrutiny. But for Linguini, the opportunity to spend time around his new mentor, Colette, makes all the stress manageable—barely. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_83729 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_83729 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colette Colette is the toughest chef and the only female in the kitchen at Gusteau ’ s. Her grit, talent, and intimidating air have brought her far, but years of climbing the ladder in the male-dominated world of haute cuisine have made her wary and self-contained. At first, she is exasperated at being assigned to babysit Linguini as he begins his trial period as a chef. But as time passes, Linguini ’ s vulnerability and guilelessness begin to win her over. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_97672 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_97672 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Anton Ego Anton Ego, the most powerful food critic in Paris, can make or break a restaurant with a single review. The sight of his dour, colorless, unsmiling face strikes fear into the heart of even the most complacently successful of culinary celebrities. Chefs have become so afraid of displeasing “The Grim Eater,” as he is commonly known, that no one dares to change a menu without his blessing. Ego has grown accustomed to this power over the years and by now regards it as his due. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_115153 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_115153 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Skinner Skinner, whose modest physical stature belies a domineering, even sadistic personality, is the chef in charge at Gusteau’s. Once the sous-chef to Gusteau himself, Skinner assumed control of the restaurant and business when the great chef died without an heir, and promptly set about exploiting Gusteau’s reputation with an extensive and mercenary line of Gusteau-branded products, from pizzas to frozen burritos. He’s driven the restaurant, once a temple of culinary art, into a profitable but soulless luxury meal machine. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_131604 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_131604 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Chefs Like a band of pirates, many nationalities often comprise the team of line chefs working in France's best restaurants. They hail from all over the world, drawn to the ship-like kitchens of the master chefs to rigorously train under the best. The kitchen can also be compared to a military operation: each chef is assigned a title, station, and specific tasks. The motley characters of Horst, Lalo, and Larousse round out the ranks at Gusteau’s. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_149175 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_149175 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Emile Emile, Remy’s little brother, is a rat’s rat—a little overweight and good-natured, he loves life and all things edible and inedible. He doesn’t always understand the finer points of his brother’s obsession with good food, but he is always ready to support Remy on one of his harebrained errands or cheer him up when he's feeling low. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_172283 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_172283 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Django Django, Remy’s father, is the patriarch of the rat clan. Django expects his oldest son, Remy, to one day take over the responsibilities of leading and providing for the extended rat family, but he is frustrated by his son’s finicky reluctance to eat perfectly good garbage. To Django, it’s clear that “humans=death” and a restaurant kitchen is no place for Remy to be hanging around, not to mention cooking. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470762949117_60972 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470762949117_60972 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design A World of Extremes From rats in sewers to fine dining in the world’s most romantic city, Ratatouille was a study in extremes. While the story involved the natural—if unlikely—contrast between Remy’s rodent upbringing and his sophisticated human desires, it also added the challenge of animating food. The food not only had to appear real and edible, it had to be worthy of characters who look at what they eat with passionate reverence. Building Paris Care And Feeding Of Your Rat Where the Color Isn’t Behind Swinging Doors Something New Old School Having broken new ground with their elaborate CG renderings, the Pixar team decided to give Ratatouille an old-school finish. For the end titles, as well as a DVD short, they enlisted hand-drawn animation, filling the halls of Pixar with the unfamiliar sound of rustling paper. According to the animators, the hands-on process was “ like going back to your hometown. ” Old School Gusteau’s On one side, Gusteau ’ s hushed, luxurious restaurant is almost like a theater, explained Production Designer Harley Jessup. On the other side is the clattery intensity of the kitchen. “ So the doorway into the dining room is almost like a stage proscenium, where waiters come out from backstage to present dishes to the audience of diners, ” Jessup noted. “ We also thought of the dining room as a palace for food and designed it both to awe the viewer and to make the food and the diners look good. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_247452 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_247452 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Linguini’s Apartment Brad Bird envisioned Linguini’s apartment as the cheapest in Paris. So the design took an unintended living space, much like an attic or storage space, that had been converted with as many inconveniences as possible. For example, Linguini has to climb up four flights of stairs with his bicycle that couldn't be left on the street for fear of being stolen, the door opens just enough to awkwardly enter, and he has to bend and stretch to maneuver around the furniture—but Linguini has what he needs: an incredible view of Paris to help him dream. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_277911 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_277911 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Paris Going strictly by the storyline, Ratatouille could have taken place almost entirely within the kitchen. But the filmmakers took every opportunity to move the action out into the photogenic streets of Paris. While the City of Light would provide eye candy for the audience, it would also serve the story, a constant reminder of the rarefied human world that made Remy’s dream so daunting. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_297982 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_297982 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sewers Production Designer Harley Jessup had long read about Paris's famous sewers, but when the Pixar team went to France for a firsthand viewing, they weren ’ t quite as evocative and romantic as envisioned. “ So, because it ’ s entertainment, because we wanted to do something that was bigger than life and caricatured, we felt the audience would respond to us taking some artistic license and creating a grander, more Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables-type of sewer. “ #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_335002 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_335002 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscript A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. Production Designer Harley Jessup conjured up his own admittedly “ informal recipe ” for a Ratatouille colorscript using gathered bunches of dyed yarns to create a rat character palette of stylized fur colors. Working with the film’s Director of Photography for Lighting Sharon Calahan, Jessup fashioned a coolly colored underground rat world against the warm, rich tones of the human world. #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_349019 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_7_1469576925637_349019 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Winner for Animated Feature Film Brad Bird Nominated for Music (Original Score) Michael Giacchino Nominated for Sound Editing Randy Thom and Michael Silvers Nominated for Sound Mixing Randy Thom Michael Semanick Doc Kane Nominated for Writing (Original Screenplay): Brad Bird Jan Pinkava Jim Capobianco American Film Institute Awards Official selection for AFI Movies of the Year Annie Awards Winner for Best Character Animation in a Feature Production Michal Makarewics Winner for Best Character Design in an Animated Feature Production Carter Goodrich Winner for Best Directing in an Animated Feature Production Brad Bird Winner for Best Music in an Animated Feature Production Michael Giacchino Winner for Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Harley Jessup Winner for Best Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production Ted Mathot Winner for Best Writing in an Animated Feature Production Brad Bird Winner for Best Animated Video Game Nominated for Best Animated Effects Gary Bruins Nominated for Best Animated Effects Jon Reisch Nominated for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production Janeane Garofalo Nominated for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production Patton Oswalt Art Directors Guild & Scenic, Title & Graphic Artists Nominated for Excellence in Production Design for a Feature Film: Fantasy Film: Harley Jessup (production designer) British Academy of Film and Television Arts Winner for Animated Film Broadcast Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animated Feature Golden Globe Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Film Grammys Winner for Best Score Soundtrack Album Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media: Michael Giacchino, Composer Dan Wallin, Engineer Hollywood Film Festival Awards Winner of Animation of the Year Award Brad Bird Los Angeles Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animation Brad Bird National Board of Review Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Producers Guild of America Awards Winner of Producer of the Year Award: Animated Theatrical Motion Pictures Brad Lewis Visual Effects Society Winner for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Motion Picture Michael Fong Apurva Shah Christine Waggoner Michael Fu Winner for Outstanding Performance by an Animated Character in an Animated Motion Picture Colette Janeane Garofalo Jamie Landes Sonoko Konishi Paul Aichele Winner for Outstanding Effects in an Animated Motion Picture Food Jon Reisch Jason Johnston Eric Froemling Tolga Goktekin Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits SCREENWRITER AND DIRECTOR Brad Bird PRODUCED BY Brad Lewis EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton ASSOCIATE PRODUCER Galyn Susman ORIGINAL STORY BY Jan Pinkava, Jim Capobianco, Brad Bird MUSIC BY Michael Giacchino STORY SUPERVISOR Mark Andrews FILM EDITOR Darren Holmes SUPERVISING TECHNICAL DIRECTOR Michael Fong PRODUCTION DESIGNER Harley Jessup SUPERVISING ANIMATORS Dylan Brown, Mark Walsh DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY - LIGHTING Sharon Calahan DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY - CAMERA Robert Anderson CHARACTER DESIGN Jason Deamer, Greg Dykstra, Carter Goodrich, Dan Lee CHARACTER SUPERVISOR Brian Green SETS ART DIRECTOR Robert Kondo SETS SUPERVISOR David Eisenmann SHADING ART DIRECTOR Belinda Van Valkenburg SHADING SUPERVISOR Daniel Mccoy GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY SUPERVISOR William Reeves EFFECTS SUPERVISOR Apurva Shah SIMULATION SUPERVISOR Christine Waggoner GROOM SUPERVISOR Sanjay Bakshi CROWDS SUPERVISOR Ziah Sarah Fogel PRODUCTION MANAGER Nicole Paradis Grindle SOUND DESIGNER Randy Thom CASTING BY Kevin Reher, Natalie Lyon CAST Remy Patton Oswalt Skinner Ian Holm Linguini Lou Romano Django Brian Dennehy Emile Peter Sohn Anton Ego Peter O’toole Gusteau Brad Garrett Colette Janeane Garofalo Horst Will Arnett Lalo & Francois Julius Callahan Larousse Mustafa John Ratzenberger Lawyer (Talon Labarthe) Teddy Newton Pompidou & Health Inspector Tony Fucile Git (Lab Rat) Jake Steinfeld Ambrister Minion Brad Bird TV Narrator Stéphane Roux"

      "Walle Character Design World Design Awards Credits Walle SCROLL DOWN Walle What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of years doing what he was built for, WALL•E discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL•E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report to the humans. Meanwhile, WALL•E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets into motion one of the most imaginative adventures ever brought to the big screen. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Pantomime The filmmakers decided that WALL•E should owe a silent debt to both R2-D2 and Buster Keaton, cinematic predecessors who proved how much can be conveyed without words. The robot would be the loneliest character Pixar had worked with, and the filmmakers crafted ways for him to perform the first act entirely in pantomime. Go Live Live Action For the first time, a Pixar film featured brief scenes with live actors. While the studio had broken all kinds of ground in computer animation, the prospect of working on a traditional live-action set was enough to get the crew excited. Along with the rare chance to coach performances and see immediate results. the Pixar team was able to enjoy some serious catering. Robo Everything! WALL•E and Eve Captain's Log WALL•E WALL•E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is the last robot left on Earth, programmed to clean up the planet, one trash cube at a time. However, after 700 years, he ’ s developed one little glitch—a personality. He ’ s extremely curious, highly inquisitive, and a little lonely. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_32267 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_32267 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } EVE EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) is a sleek, state-of-the-art probe-droid. She’s fast, she flies, and she’s equipped with a laser gun. EVE, also called Probe One by the captain of the Axiom (the enormous luxury mother ship which houses thousands of displaced humans), is one of a fleet of similar robots sent to Earth on an undisclosed scanning mission. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_51582 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_51582 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } M-O M-O (Microbe-Obliterator) is a cleaner-bot programmed to clean anything that comes aboard the Axiom that is deemed a “foreign contaminant.” M-O travels speedily around the Axiom on his roller ball, cleaning the dirty objects he encounters. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_70794 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_70794 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Auto Auto is the Axiom’s autopilot, who has piloted the ship through all of its 700 years in space. A carefully programmed robot in the form of the ship’s steering wheel, Auto’s manner is cold, mechanical, and seemingly dutiful to the captain. Unknown to all the Axiom crew, a hidden mandate exists in Auto’s programming. Auto is determined to execute these secret orders at any cost, regardless of the consequences for the inhabitants of the Axiom. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_105093 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_105093 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Captain Captain is the current commander of the Axiom. Trapped in a routine, like WALL•E, the captain longs for a break in the tiresome cycle of his so-called life. His uneventful duties are simply checking and rechecking the ship ’ s status with Auto, the autopilot. When he is informed of a long-awaited discovery by one of the probe-droids, he discovers his inner calling to become the courageous leader he never could have imagined and plots a new course for humanity. #block-yui_3_17_2_18_1468953697596_100644 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_18_1468953697596_100644 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } John and Mary John and Mary are two of the humans living on the Axiom, where they have settled into a life of pampered luxury. The arrival of WALL•E jolts them from their daily routines and causes them to realize the existence of one another, and that there may be more to life than floating around on their high-tech deck chairs. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_120964 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1470763803742_120964 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Found World \"Science fiction typically involves a fantasy tale, often set in space or the future: therefore, everything (and I mean everything) is made up. And almost every member of our cast is a robot. The questions and demands of this world were nearly as infinite as space itself. But the goal was always clear—to make us believe this world already existed and that we, the filmmakers, had just simply found it,\" recalls director Andrew Stanton. Building Worlds From The Sound Up The Language of Sound Set in a time and place yet to exist, WALL•E required an entirely original language of sound. Because the film featured few humans and almost no traditional dialogue, every beep or clank would have to mean something. To answer the challenge, the filmmakers turned to the father of modern sound design, legendary Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. The Truck Trash Planet The Imperfect Lens Earth The dystopian planet of WALL•E was a blend of the fantastic and familiar. Audiences needed to recognize Earth but also understand how things had gone wrong on such a massive scale. In a short scene that followed WALL•E on his daily routine, the filmmakers wanted to reveal the planet's history in entirely visual terms. Dubbed “ The Walk Home, ” the segment used 10 of the most complicated sets ever created by Pixar, at the time, to tell a wordless, one-minute story. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_15593 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_15593 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Truck Even a robot on a dystopian planet needs a place to call home. At first WALL•E ’ s truck is enlivened only by a cockroach and a Hello, Dolly! video. The atmosphere changes when EVE comes in. “ We wanted it to feel really romantic, ” explains Danielle Feinberg, director of photography for lighting. “ So he plugs in a cord and turns on the Christmas lights he ’ s got strung all over and you immediately feel we ’ re in this nice, cozy intimate interior and this is WALL•E ’ s date night. “ #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470765982462_30135 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470765982462_30135 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Space Every film presents new opportunities for Pixar to interpret and design environments, imaginary or not. Using computers makes the art design choices as limitless as outer space. For WALL•E, the goal was not to reinvent space but to make design choices to enhance the story. The filmmakers wanted to ensure the audiences would be immersed in the story's action so they made a design choice to cheat the stars closer to camera than they would actually be in space so that the stars would move in the frame and allow the viewer to easily perceive the movement of the characters. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_48777 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_48777 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Axiom The luxury spaceship Axiom cuts an impressive profile. But unlike the mammoth space vehicles in most science fiction epics, it wasn’t designed to inspire fear or engage in deep space battle. Instead the Pixar team envisioned the last refuge of a consumer culture, a self-contained world built by the Buy n' Large Corporation, loaded with excess and wandering adrift with the remnants of human race. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_64042 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468960176482_64042 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscripts A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. \"I started by separating the two worlds using color. Earth is dusty, high contrast, and monochromatic, to support the idea that WAL•E ’ s life is drab and never changing. Then as EVE arrives and WALL•E cozies up to her, the colors become a little warmer. When we get to the Axiom it ’ s all about sterility … the passengers don ’ t have to think. The colors are more artificial, more planned, more consumer oriented. It ’ s not gaudy, but there ’ s a lot more color in Act Two than most people anticipate,\" explains production designer Ralph Eggleston. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470765982462_42705 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1470765982462_42705 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy Awards Winner for Animated Feature Film Andrew Stanton Nominated for Music (Original Score) Thomas Newman Nominated for Music (Original Song) \"Down to Earth\" - Music by Peter Gabriel and Thomas Newman; Lyrics by Peter Gabriel Nominated for Sound Editing Ben Burtt and Matthew Wood Nominated for Sound Mixing Tom Myers, Michael Semanick and Ben Burtt Nominated for Writing (Original Screenplay) Andrew Stanton, Jim Reardon Original story by Andrew Stanton,Pete Docter Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy & Horror Films Nominated for Saturn Award for Best Animated Film Nominated for Saturn Award for Best Director Andrew Stanton Alliance of Women Film Journalists Winner of EDA Award for Best Screenplay,Original Andrew Stanton Pete Docter Jim Reardon American Cinema Editors Winner of ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film (Comedy or Musical) Stephen Schaffer American Film Institute Official Selection AFI Movies of the Year Annie Awards Nominated for Best Animated Feature Nominated for Best Animated Video Game: Heavy Iron Studios, a division of THQ, Inc.

      "Up Character Design World Design Awards Credits Up SCROLL DOWN Up A 78-year-old curmudgeonly balloon salesman, is not your average hero. When he ties thousands of balloons to his house and flies away to the wilds of South America, he finally fulfills his lifelong dream of adventure. But after Carl discovers an 8-year-old stowaway named Russell, this unlikely duo soon finds themselves on a hilarious journey in a lost world filled with danger and surprises. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Simple Shapes The characters in Up literally took shape on the page. Believing that basic visual cues convey much about personality, the filmmakers boiled the characters down to their physical essence. Carl was shaped as a brick, weighed down and resistant to change. Russell was shaped like an upside-down egg, innocent, unfinished, and optimistic. Russel: Wildreness Explorer Our Giant Flightles Friend: Kevin The Many Endings Of Muntz Married Life Geriatric Hero Carl Fredricksen Carl Fredricksen is not your average hero. He's a retired balloon salesman who, at the age of 78, is forced to leave the house he and his late wife Ellie built together. But instead of moving into the old folks' home, Carl takes action. He ties thousands of balloons to the roof, lifts the house into the air, and sets off toward South America, finally fulfilling the promise he made to his wife so many years before. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_40139 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_40139 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Russell Russell is an enthusiastic and persistent 8-year-old Junior Wilderness Explorer from Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12. Armed with a backpack laden with official Wilderness Explorer camping gear, Russell is ready for the wilderness! There's just one catch: he's never actually left the city. All his knowledge of the outdoors comes from books, and his sole camping experience was in his own living room. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_70699 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_70699 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dug Dug is a lovable golden retriever living in the wilds of Paradise Falls as part of the dog pack searching for a rare flightless bird. Like the rest of his pack, Dug is outfitted with a remarkable high-tech collar that translates his thoughts into speech. But Dug is mocked as the nerd of the pack. Sent into the jungle on a \"special\" mission, Dug accidentally succeeds when he discovers the bird following Carl and Russell. As they are pursued through the jungle by his own pack, the sweet but simple-minded Dug must decide which pack he actually belongs to. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_94080 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_94080 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Kevin Named by Russell, this extremely rare, 13-foot-tall flightless bird is hidden from the world in her remote Paradise Falls habitat. With brilliant iridescent feathers and a long, flexible neck, Kevin is exceptionally fast and nimble despite her size. In fact, the massive bird often gets into some very curious and seemingly impossible positions. Very few know that this scientifically invaluable creature exists, but Carl and Russell stumble upon the bird, and Russell names her Kevin after he discovers they share a sweet tooth. Kevin and Russell bond instantly, and despite the bird's propensity to swallow Carl's walker, Kevin joins the jungle's latest and most unlikely pack along with Carl, Russell and Dug. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_113714 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_113714 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Charles F. Muntz In the early 1930s, rich, clever, and handsome Charles F. Muntz is a beacon of hope for a down-and-out American public. He inspires his biggest fans, youngsters Carl and Ellie, to parrot his famous mantra \"adventure is out there!\" Traveling the globe many times over in his massive self-designed airship, he discovers the world's treasures: priceless historic relics, amazing scientific discoveries, and exotic flora and fauna never before seen. But when Muntz brings home the skeleton of a fantastic 13-foot-tall creature from a remote mountain in South America, he is discredited by scientists. Vowing to prove them wrong, Muntz returns to South America, swearing to bring back a live specimen, and he won't come back until he does! #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_138340 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_138340 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Alpha Pack Deep in the jungles of Paradise Falls resides a dog pack on a mission to capture a rare bird that their master is pursuing. Just like their rejected comrade Dug, all the pack dogs have high-tech collars that give them unusual abilities especially designed for sinister hunting expeditions, including GPS tracking and translating their thoughts into speech. Alpha, the pack leader, is a menacing-looking, black-as-night Doberman Pinscher with authority entrusted to him by their master that no one dares question. Beta, a tough Rottweiler, is Alpha's lieutenant, and Gamma, a rough-and-tumble bulldog, is his hench-dog. Nothing will detract the pack from its mission—except maybe a squirrel. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_162092 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_162092 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Ellie Ellie is an exuberant, adventurous girl who dreams of exploring the world. She and Carl first bond over their shared admiration for legendary explorer Charles F. Muntz. They pledge to travel together to Paradise Falls—the world's tallest waterfall, deep in the South American rainforest. As the couple settle into their married life, their grandiose plans are set aside as they navigate the ups and downs of their everyday lives. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_185344 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_185344 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design \"Simplexity\" The world of Up began with the thought of escape. From the claustrophobic shapes of an encroaching cityscape to the uncharted wilds of South America, from Muntz's half-mile long dirigible to Carl's uniquely mobile home, the Pixar team employed its newly invented concept of \"simplexity\" to push the visual envelope while keeping the world believable. Balloon and Flight Adventure Is Out There! Homemakers Of Pixar The Egg Research “ Adventure is out there! ” is the familiar motto from Up that inspired many . And the directors and artists proved it to themselves when they sought firsthand reference to design the pinnacle world where Carl ’ s journey would end. Together, they climbed mountains, trampled through jungle, and even got caught in a storm atop a tepui mountain in South America. “ The research trip to Venezuela was one of the highlights of my career, ” said Production Designer Ricky Nierva, “ but I ’ m also glad we made it back alive to make the movie! ” #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_204798 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_204798 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The House Unlike most stories about leaving home, Up needed a house that would go along for the journey. The Pixar team treated Carl ’ s house like a film character, touring vintage Oakland and Berkeley neighborhoods to cast for the right mix of comfort and familiarity, with just a touch of melancholy. “ We were trying to make Carl ’ s house look like your grandparents ’ house smelled, ” explained Producer Jonas Rivera. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_215333 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_215333 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Tepui Carl ’ s epic adventure required a destination both fantastic and plausible. When Director Pete Docter happened on a television documentary about the mysterious tepuis of South America, he discovered the perfect world to explore. The massive mile-high plateaus in Venezuela are among the most uncharted places on Earth. Pixar sent a team of artists for a look, and the film's bizarre rock formations, exotic flora, towering waterfall, and fog-shrouded labyrinth can be traced to tepui landscapes. So fantastic were the images, Docter wondered if the very real Tepuis might look too incredible. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_235555 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_235555 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Airship With Charles Muntz, the most fabled adventurer of his day, the filmmakers gave him the 1930s ’ most state-of-the-art airship. Encouraged to indulge in size and detail, the artists created a half-mile-long art deco masterpiece filled with the spoils of a hero turned villain. Still, there were issues of how far to take the airship. “ We had a trophy room with an Easter Island head in there, ” recalled Production Artist Noah Klocek. “ At one point John Lasseter said 'no, that would sink the ship'. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_257382 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_257382 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscript A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. “ While Ellie is alive, our color palette is heavily saturated. She brings color into Carl ’ s life. When she ’ s gone, the palette is de-saturated to shades of gray. When Carl blows up the balloons to begin his journey, we bring back the memory of Ellie through those saturated, beautiful colors. Any time we have life or movement forward, we use color saturation. But when there is impending doom, we almost go to black and white. ” - Ricky Nierva, Production Designer #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_277000 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469576925637_277000 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards 3D Society Winner of the Stereoscopic 3D Lumiere Award for Animated 3D Feature Academy Awards Winner for Animated Feature Film Pete Docter Winner for Music (Original Score) Michael Giacchino Nominated for Best Picture Jonas Rivera Nominated for Writing (Original Screenplay) Screenplay by Bob Peterson, Pete Docter.

      "Toy Story 3 Character Design World Design Awards Credits Toy Story 3 SCROLL DOWN Toy Story 3 The creators of the beloved Toy Story films re-open the toy box and bring moviegoers back to the delightful world of our favorite gang of toy characters in Toy Story 3. As Andy prepares to depart for college, Buzz, Woody, and the rest of his loyal toys are troubled about their uncertain future. Toy Story 3 is a comical adventure that lands the toys in a room full of untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these \"new\" toys. It's pandemonium as the toys try to stay together, ensuring that \"no toy gets left behind.\" Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Reintroductions Enough time had gone by that viewers needed a reintroduction to Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Andy’s toys. At the same time the filmmakers needed to give purpose and personality to the toys that would inhabit Bonnie’s world and the day care center, which included a plush pink villain. Toys! Goodbye Andy Accidental Toymakers Woody Woody is a cowboy sheriff who proclaims his signature catchphrases from the 1950s TV show Woody’s Roundup every time his pull-string is pulled.

His bedroom walls, once covered with Buzz Lightyear posters, are now plastered with images of sports cars, rock bands, and skateboarders. Although Andy no longer brings his old toys out from the chest for playtime, he hasn’t been able to bring himself to get rid of them. With his imminent departure looming, and his mom's prodding, the time has come for Andy to decide the fate of his favorite toys. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_163975 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_163975 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bonnie Bonnie is a 4-year-old girl who goes to Sunnyside Daycare. Although shy when around many adults, she is full of energy and creativity. She loves to wear lots of textures and colors, like her pink tutu with yellow boots and a blue backpack. She's filled with imagination that helps her create endless new games and scenarios with her toys. She can never have too many toys because those that she has will always be loved, well cared for, and—best of all—played with. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_206817 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_206817 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Life Of A Shot Pixar Goes To Prison Western Opening From the beginning, the filmmakers had wanted a Western-themed opening for Toy Story 3 . Taking a visual cue from the original wallpaper in Andy’s bedroom, the big blue sky provided the canopy for Woody’s heroic runaway train rescue set in the desert Southwest. But for the third cinematic Toy Story opening sequence, the Pixar team took the action majestically over the top with spaceships, dinosaurs, and a memorable Death by Monkeys finale. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_257156 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_257156 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Landfill The choice of a landfill for the climactic sequence fit director Lee Unkrich ’ s notion of Toy Story as a life-cycle trilogy. For the characters, the dump would be the equivalent of Dante ’ s Inferno: a grim, dehumanized landscape and final destination. Pixar artists studied real dumps to emulate, but they also heightened the elements to maximize the drama. According to Lighting Art Director, Dice Tsutsumi, “ The dump is the one scene out of all the Toy Story films that needs to feel absolutely real, believable, and scary. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_271675 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_271675 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Andy's Room By now Andy ’ s room has become an emblem of the Toy Story movies and of Pixar itself. The idyllic blue sky and white cloud wallpaper of Toy Story gives way to a galaxy of stars in Toy Story 2 . For Toy Story 3, the artifacts on the walls, and even the more subdued sunlight streaming into the room, conveyed the realm of a teenager and the new problem facing the toys: Andy ’ s imminent departure for college. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_288744 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_288744 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bonnie's Room Bonnie’s room presented a major challenge for the Pixar team. They needed the audience to immediately like the new little girl character and relate to her own collection of toys. Bonnie’s room had to be viewed as a place of safety and imagination, where toys are cherished, respected, and played with. And they had to do all this without giving away the ending. While critical story elements would take place in Bonnie’s room, it had to be treated as a speed bump in Woody’s journey home. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_306853 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_306853 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sunnyside Daycare Sunnyside Daycare had to play two crucial roles in the film: a warm and welcoming environment one minute, an oppressive prison lockdown the next. Either way, the Pixar artists had to make Sunnyside always appear as a credible day care center. The crews took field trips to various child-care facilities in the Bay Area where they identified patterns in the organization and structure of bins. It also proved valuable in getting the child ’ s perspective. “ Being there is great,\" said Production Designer Bob Pauley, \"because you notice, wow … that chair ’ s tiny. Those toilets are tiny. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_326023 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_326023 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Research For authenticity and inspiration, the Pixar team engaged in several field trips. With much of the film taking place at Sunnyside, the filmmakers toured multiple day care centers. Figuring that a day care center might feel like prison to a toy, they also took an outing to Alcatraz. The Pixar team also spent hours scouring the local dump for angles. “ The Ratatouille artists went to Paris. The Paris of Toy Story 3 is the dump. The Ratatouille crew got a better deal, ” said Production Designer Bob Pauley. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469576112969_202599 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469576112969_202599 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscripts A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. “ I embrace what John and everybody else had done for Toy Story and Toy Story 2 because both films are fantastic. As I studied the earlier movies, I found that so many elements of the art direction had a lot of thinking behind them. Those visuals aren ’ t the result of intuitive or arbitrary choices: the artists were thinking about how to best support the story, ” said Art Director Daisuke “ Dice ” Tsutsumi. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_379989 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468965567264_379989 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards 1UP.com Winner of 1UP's 2010 Game of the Year Award for Best Family Game: Disney Interactive Studios Academy Awards Winner for Animated Feature Film Lee Unkrich Winner for Music (Original Song) Randy Newman Nominated for Best Picture Darla Anderson Nominated for Sound Editing Tom Myers and Michael Silvers Nominated for Writing (Adapted Screenplay) Michael Arndt Story by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich Alliance of Women Film Journalists Winner of Excellent Dynamic Activism Award for Best Animated Film American Cinema Editors Winner of Eddie Award for Best Edited Animated Feature Film Ken Schretzmann & Lee Unkrich, A.C.E American Film Institute Top Ten Movies of the Year Annie Awards Nominated for Best Animated Feature Nominated for Best Directing: Lee Unkrich Nominated for Best Screenplay: Michael Arndt AOL Moviefone 50 Best Movies of 2010 - #1 Austin Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animated Feature Top 10 Films of 2010 - #4 Boston Society of Film Critics Winner for Best Animated Film Runner-up for Best Picture British Academy of Film and Television Arts Winner for Animated Film Lee Unkrich Nominated for Adapted Screenplay Michael Arndt Nominated for Special Visual Effects Broadcast Film Critics Association Winner of Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature Nominated for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Picture Nominated for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Sound Nominated for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song: \"We Belong Together\" - performed and written by Randy Newman Central Ohio Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animated Film Runner-Up for Best Adapted Screenplay Michael Arndt Best Films - #5 Chicago Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animated Feature Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay Michael Arndt Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Winner for Best Animated Film Top 10 films eDIT 13 Filmmaker's Festival Festival Honors: Pixar Florida Film Critics Circle Winner for Best Animated Film Golden Globe Awards Winner for Best Animated Feature Film Grammys Winner for Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Randy Newman, composer Hollywood Film Festival Winner of Hollywood Animation Award Nominated for Hollywood Movie of the Year Award Hollywood Post Alliance Nominated for Outstanding Editing — Feature Film: Ken Schretzmann and Lee Unnkrich, A.C.E .

      "Cars 2 Character Design World Design Awards Credits Cars 2 SCROLL DOWN Cars 2 Star racecar Lightning McQueen and the incomparable tow truck Mater take their friendship to exciting new places in Cars 2 when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours, and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design What Would Mater Do? Cars 2 continues the unlikely best-friendship of Lightning McQueen and Mater, and also required the tow truck to drive the film’s action-adventure plotline. “What would Mater do?” became the mantra for Pixar’s creative team as the story entered each new locale. The character of Finn McMissile was revived from a discarded scene in Cars, in which the ultracool spy car starred in the drive-in movie Sally and McQueen were attending. Mater Takes Toyko Lemon-Aides Orgins of Cars 2 Mater In the now-popular tourist destination of Radiator Springs, the rusty old tow truck Mater has a number of roles, including proprietor of Tow Mater Towing and Salvage, grand storyteller, and the heart and soul of the town. But Mater’s favorite title is best friend to Lightning McQueen. Mater values each and every dent he’s earned on his escapades with Lightning over the years, and anxiously awaits further fun with his friend when Lightning returns with his latest Piston Cup. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_15962 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_15962 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Lightning McQueen Number 95 Lightning McQueen is still a hotshot race car, but his rookie days are past him. Now a permanent resident of Radiator Springs, Lightning has become a bona fide worldwide celebrity as winner of four Piston Cups. After his latest win, Lightning returns home to enjoy life in the slow lane for a while with sweetheart Sally, best friend Mater and the rest of his Radiator Springs family. His off-season is unexpectedly cut short when Mater inadvertently prompts Lightning to enter the World Grand Prix, a high profile, three-part exhibition race that will take him around the globe. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_29019 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_29019 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Francesco Bernoulli Francesco Bernoulli grew up in the shadow of the famous Monza racecourse in Italy, where he and his friends would sneak onto the track and race the famous Pista di Alta Velocita bank turn. He was an instant winner on the amateur circuit and soon became an international Formula Racer champion. The ladies love Francesco ’ s open wheels, youngsters look up to his winning spirit, and fellow racers envy his speed. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_44578 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_44578 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Finn McMissile Finn McMissile is a master British spy. Though charming and eloquent, it’s his stealth maneuvering, intelligence, and years in the field that enable him to thwart unexpected attacks from bad guys and make quick daredevil escapes. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_63767 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_63767 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Holley Shiftwell Holley Shiftwell is a beautiful young British desk agent turned rookie field spy stationed in Tokyo. Well educated and sharp, she knows every trick in the book—or rather, she relies on every trick in the spy manual. She’s armed with the latest state-of-the-art spy equipment imaginable, from hidden cameras and concealed weapons to a telescoping utility arm and a holographic pop-up display. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_83382 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_83382 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Professor Z Professor Z, aka The Professor, is an internationally wanted weapons designer in a small, sophisticated German package. He's a brilliant—but mad—monocle-wearing scientist who's plotting to sabotage the World Grand Prix. Though his true motive is unclear, Professor Z is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate all obstacles and keep the “ project ” on schedule. #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_105491 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_62_1468971222097_105491 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Miles Axlerod Sir Miles Axlerod is a former oil baron who has sold off his fortune, converted himself into an electric vehicle, and devoted his life to finding the renewable, clean-burning energy source of the future—ultimately discovering what he believes is the fuel everyone should be using. Axlerod is also the creator of the World Grand Prix, a three-country race that attracts the world’s top athletes. But the race is really an excuse to show off his new wonder-fuel, Allinol. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_29190 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_29190 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Acer Acer has always felt like an outcast in the car world. The beat-up green AMC Pacer joined forces with fellow “lemon” cars as henchmen for the devious Professor Z, whose clandestine mission is to wreak havoc at the highly visible World Grand Prix. Acer must hunt down the American and British secret agents who’ve stolen crucial information about Professor Z’s underhanded plot—his primary target just happens to be Mater, who’s been mistaken for a spy. Acer tries very hard to be a tough guy, but he’s overeager compared to his no-nonsense accomplice Grem. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_53146 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_53146 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Grem Grem is a dented, rusty orange AMC Gremlin. After years of being dismissed for his design, even being called a “lemon,” Grem has a big chip on his fender that has led him to the underworld of international espionage. As a henchman for a villainous boss, Professor Z, Grem and his partner-in-crime Acer are trying to sabotage the World Grand Prix and the famous race cars competing in it. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469570463626_107059 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1469570463626_107059 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Racers Known as the “ World ’ s Greatest Rally Car, ” #6 Raoul ÇaRoule was born in Alsace, France. A restless soul, Raoul joined the famous Cirque des Voitures French circus where he learned Gymkhana—a graceful, drift-filled motorsport that taught him pinpoint timing and an unparalleled ability to navigate tricky courses with ease. He ’ s the first car to ever win nine consecutive rallies. Raoul is confident he can use his rally experience to pull ahead of his fellow World Grand Prix racers during the touchy dirt sections of the three courses, especially with his fans in the stands waving banners that read “ ÇaRoule Ca-Rules! ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_82880 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_82880 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Siddeley Siddeley is a state-of-the-art British twin-engine spy jet. Measuring 176 feet from nose to tail with an impressive 157-foot wingspan, the super sleek, silver-bodied Siddeley streaks through international skies at Mach 1 speeds. Outfitted with all the latest in high-tech spy equipment including cloaking technology, defensive weaponry, and afterburners, Siddeley is Finn McMissile ’ s steadfast partner in fighting crime around the globe. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_114090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469041716643_114090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The International World of Cars 2 The safety and simplicity of Radiator Springs quickly gave way to the glamorous hotspots of international racing. The challenge was finding a way to caricature and \"car-ify\" each country. “By caricaturing I think of it as celebrating,” said Production Designer Harley Jessup. “Our approach is to show those locations in the most beautiful way we can.\" Paris Italy Somewhere In The Pacific (Not) Lost In Translation With over 45 translations, the creators of Cars 2 were faced with the monumental challenge of interpreting the films original language (English) to a host of divergent cultures. This task required that the filmmakers use a \"idiomatic adaptation,\" which would allow for the original English's subtleties, gags and plot twists to resonate for each unique language. Oil Rig “ I really wanted to start off with something that was the complete opposite of what the audience would expect from the sequel to Cars, ” said Director John Lasseter. “ People are expecting to see Lightning McQueen, Mater, stock car racing, Radiator Springs, Route 66, the Southwest … but instead, the first thing you see is ocean. And then there ’ s a boat. And out in the middle of the ocean, there ’ s a little car riding on this boat and he ’ s looking for another car. You ’ re thinking, ‘ Wait a minute—what ’ s going on here?!' ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_21070 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_21070 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Tokyo Setting the tone for the film ’ s fictional World Grand Prix, the opening race in Tokyo took inspiration from Singapore ’ s Formula One night race. “ Having the Tokyo race take place at night let us showcase a really rich and beautiful range of light sources, from glowing lanterns to the amazing neon signs downtown to the chaos of light reflecting on the cars themselves, ” said Director of Photography for Lighting, Sharon Calahan. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_36795 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_36795 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Italy After adapting the Grand Prix races to the real cities of Tokyo and London, the filmmakers decided to create the Italian Riviera town of Porto Corsa from whole cloth. Though fictional, Porto Corsa proudly displays the influences of Vernazza, Genoa, Positano, Monte Carlo, and Portofino. “ We wanted it to be our love letter to European racing and to Italy, ” explained Co-Director Brad Lewis. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_52876 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_52876 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Paris After jettisoning plans for a 24-hour endurance race through Paris, the filmmakers gave the City of Light a more mysterious role. Inspired by classic action-thriller films, they used Paris for a chase veering away from the postcard imagery of the usual lush travelogue backdrop. The Pixar team found inspiration in vintage photos of Paris ’ s old central market, Les Halles, to create an unexpected setting for the black market storyline. . #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_72043 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_72043 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } London London provided the Cars 2 art team ’ s biggest challenge, requiring over 50 miles of city streets and thousands of uniquely \"car-ified\" buildings exhibiting a wide variety of architectural styles. Along with celebrated landmarks like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, the filmmakers got to make distinctively British characters out of such revered vehicles as Range Rovers, Jaguars, Minis, and the London double-decker bus. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_95500 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_95500 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Colorscript A colorscript is a sequence of small pastel drawings or paintings used to emphasize color in each scene and establish a film's visual language. Given the film ’ s multiple real-world locations, the Cars 2 team fashioned separate palettes to capture the iconic atmosphere of each city along with the changing mood of the story, from the dazzling contrasts of Tokyo at night to the sun-drenched warmth of the Italian Riviera. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_118073 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469042219204_118073 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards ASIFA-Hollywood Annie Awards Best Animated Feature Production-NoMinee Animated Effects in an Animation Production-NOMINEEs Eric Froemling JON REISCH Character Design in a Feature Production-Nominee Jay Shuster Production Design in a Feature Production-Nominee Harley Jessup Storyboarding in a Feature Production-Nominee Scott Morse Editing in a Feature Production-Nominee Stephen Schaffer, A.C.E.

      "Brave Character Design World Design Awards Credits Brave SCROLL DOWN Brave Since ancient times, stories of epic battles and mystical legends have been passed through the generations across the rugged and mysterious Highlands of Scotland. A new tale joins the lore when the courageous Merida confronts tradition and challenges destiny to change her fate. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Story of Brave Brave introduces a multitude of new characters to audiences, from the fiery teenage princess Merida to the murderous bear Mor’du. When Merida’s mother, the dignified and elegant Queen Elinor, is transformed into a bear, mother and daughter must work together to find a way to reverse the spell, all the while attempting to placate feuding lords and avoid the kingdom’s most renowned bear hunter—King Fergus himself. Merida and Elinor English (Sort of) Dirty Hairy People Merida Passionate and fiery, Merida is a headstrong teenager of royal upbringing who is struggling to take control of her own destiny. She feels most at home in the outdoors honing her impressive athletic skills as an archer and swordfighter, and racing across the magnificent Highland countryside with her faithful horse, Angus. With a spirit as vibrant as her untamed hair, Merida also has a softness of heart, especially when it comes to her wee triplet brothers. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_25730 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_25730 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Queen Elinor A vision of grace, wisdom and strength of character, Queen Elinor is fiercely dedicated to the well being of her family and kingdom. As the measured, diplomatic counterpoint to her more impulsive husband, King Fergus, Elinor carries the weight of the kingdom on her shoulders in order to maintain the fragile peace between the volatile clans. Elinor strives to instill in Merida the knowledge and manner of a royal, expecting complete commitment to Elinor’s standards. But her vision of her daughter’s future is at odds with Merida’s rebellious spirit and desire to forge her own path, which ultimately causes Elinor to face calamitous consequences. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_44171 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_44171 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } King Fergus King Fergus is a heroic warrior with a majestic bear cape, broad sword and a knobby peg leg – the result of his much-regaled skirmish with the demon bear Mor ’ du. His vendetta against the beast who took his leg makes Fergus a ferocious and determined bear hunter, evidenced by a home full of mounted trophies of every size. Protector of his kingdom and family, Fergus has a heart as big as his triplet sons are mischievous, and boundless love for his wife, Queen Elinor. But his pride for his first-born daughter Merida is unmatched, and he has gifted her his great skill and passion for the sword and the bow. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_59417 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468947918906_59417 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Triplets Identical triplets Harris, Hubert and Hamish are adorable, redheaded, and always ready to stir up a bit of mischief, especially if sweets are at stake. They can communicate wordlessly with their sly smiles, subtle glances and rascally giggles. This troublemaking trio is particularly keen on sneaking through the secret passages of the castle, mysteriously appearing out of walls, and playing clever tricks on everyone, especially their father, King Fergus. They share an extra special bond with their big sister, Merida, who is among the few who can actually tell them apart. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_34188 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_34188 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bear Queen At first, Queen Elinor is determined not to let her new, ursine form get in the way of her usual routines and manners. But she soon discovers that survival in the wild carries with it a different set of rules, and realizes she must look to her daughter for guidance in this new and unfamiliar environment. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_54047 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_54047 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Angus Black as night with an ivory muzzle and fetlocks, Angus is Merida ’ s powerful Clydesdale and her most trusted confidant. Angus is Merida ’ s escape from castle life into the deep forest and the highlands beyond. Merida target shoots from her perch on his broad back and is able to coax him into one adventure after another. Angus can be balky, stubborn and faint-hearted at times, but is ultimately a devoted and faithful friend to Merida. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_75392 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952263481_75392 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Witch Deep in the overgrown Highland forest, a ramshackle blackhouse cottage is home to the Crafty Carver. This seemingly harmless, eccentric and long-in-the-tooth crone specializes in the whittling of wooden bear trinkets, figurines and curios. But the mysterious recluse is more than meets the eye. When Merida sees through the guise and reveals her as the Witch she truly is, Merida begs for a magical solution to her problems. The Witch begrudgingly gives in, conjuring a haphazard spell with an obscure riddle, which holds Merida ’ s fate in the balance. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_30426 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_30426 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Lords The three lords of the kingdom – Dingwall, Macintosh and MacGuffin – are the unruly, overzealous leaders of their respective clans. Though once warring factions, they have been united under the sword of King Fergus and held together by the diplomacy and political savvy of Queen Elinor. The clans are summoned to Castle DunBroch to compete in the Highland Games, but the lords are soon outraged when Merida defies a sacred tradition. The clans fall back to their history of fervent feuding, which threatens the fragile peace of the entire kingdom. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_56780 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_56780 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Stories of Scotland The film’s setting in lush, wild Scotland was an essential source of inspiration. Recalls Director Mark Andrews, “We went to the highest part of Scotland and the lowest part of Scotland—and everything had a story.” Wonder Moss Brave Old World Magic Castle DunBroch Castle DunBroch was deliberately designed to be almost part of the promontory on which it sits. “We didn’t want the castle to be a new castle,” says production designer Steve Pilcher. “No way! We wanted it to have been there a few hundred years before the film took place.” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_104667 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_104667 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Highlands Production designer Steve Pilcher says that the notoriously variable Highland weather was one of the most important elements to capture in order to convey the right sense of place. “Mist, rock, ruggedness, skies that are changing all the time with the rain, snow, big patches of sunlight moving over large landscapes…That’s what has to come across.” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_117283 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468952640806_117283 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Research Trips Brave's creative team made multiple trips to Scotland, determined to get the details just right. They returned with notebooks full of drawings and memories, and cameras filled with pictures—everything from majestic panoramas to careful studies of lichens and mosses. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_21241 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_21241 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Standing Stones Merida ’ s fate changes when will-o ’ -the-wisps lead her to a mysterious ring of ancient stones. The Standing Stones, which became the film ’ s visual anchor, were inspired by the real-life Callanish Stones on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland ’ s Outer Hebrides. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_44106 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_44106 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Witch Hut When Merida first enters the mysterious hut in the forest, the woman within claims to be no more than a simple woodworker—the Crafty Carver. It doesn ’ t take long, however, to discover that she is rather more than she seems. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_63038 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468953302040_63038 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) – Academy Awards Best Animated Feature Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman American Cinema Editors (ACE) Eddie Awards Best Edited Animated Feature Film Nicolas C.

      "Monsters University Character Design World Design Awards Credits Monsters University SCROLL DOWN Monsters University We all know Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan to be an inseparable pair, but that wasn’t always the case. From the moment these two mismatched monsters met they couldn't stand each other. Monsters University unlocks the door to how Mike and Sulley overcame their differences and became the best of friends. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design Young Monsters How do you make an eyeball look eighteen years old? That's just one question the filmmakers asked when coming up with a younger version of Mike. Set during their formidable college years, Monsters University sees much younger versions of Mike and Sulley. Mike is a little smaller, and even has a retainer, while Sulley is shaggier, thinner and not quite bulked up to the Scarer we know him to be. Story School Scare Tactics Furry Monsters Mike Wazowski Mike Wazowski ’ s lifelong dream is to become a Scarer at Monsters, Inc.—and he ’ s sure he knows just how to do it. Ever since he was a young monster, Mike ’ s had his eye on Monsters University, home of the world ’ s top Scare Program. Now a freshman and hopeful scare student, he ’ s well versed in the rich history, theory and technique required to reach his goal, and the little green one-eyed monster has more confidence, enthusiasm, determination and heart than all of his classmates combined. But unexpected roadblocks derail Mike ’ s plans and he ’ s forced to team up with a group of misfit monsters and an unlikely ally to give it the old college try and pull off the biggest coup in the University ’ s history. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_38418 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_38418 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } James P. Sullivan When it comes to scaring, Sulley ’ s a natural—his abundant size, fierce roar and family legacy of a long line of high-achieving Scarers make him a shoo-in for the esteemed Scare Program at Monsters University. But from the moment the overly confident monster steps his big furry feet on campus, it ’ s clear he ’ d rather crack jokes than books—and he learns the hard way that his unfettered talent and family ties can only get him so far. With his ego bruised and future in jeopardy, a stubborn Sulley must put his pride aside, team up with an odd bunch of misfit monsters and actually work if he wants to live up to his true scaring potential. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_81984 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_81984 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Randy Boggs Monsters University freshman Randy Boggs has big aspirations for college life. The peculiar lizard-like monster with his host of gangly arms and legs plans to major in Scaring and lead an active social life filled with fun, friends and fraternity parties. If only he could get his embarrassing disappearing habit under control, he ’ d be good to go, because how is he ever going to be a great Scarer if nobody can see him? #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_102090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_102090 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dean Hardscrabble To Dean Hardscrabble, there are scary monsters and there are all other monsters. It ’ s no surprise she feels this way—she is, after all, a legendary Scarer and Dean of the School of Scaring at Monsters University. Aspiring Scare students must be up for the challenge to impress her, though she is convinced that her assessment of who is truly scary and who is not is never wrong. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_117772 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_117772 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Scott \"Squishy\" Squibbles Scott Squibbles gives new meaning to the term “ undeclared. ” A sophomore whose dream of becoming a Scarer was squashed in his first year at Monsters University, “ Squishy ” is a bit of a wide-eyed wanderer—small, sweet, naïve and quiet—who, not surprisingly, still lives with his doting mother. But with a little help from his Oozma Kappa brothers, Squishy begins to realize he ’ s more than just that shy monster in the corner. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_151329 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468881055471_151329 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Don Carlton Faced with the realities of the economic downturn, Midwestern sales monster Don Carlton finds himself going back to school to learn new skills and pursue a dream career in Scaring. One of Monsters University's “mature” students and a founding member of the Oozma Kappa fraternity, Don brings his honest hardworking spirit to their endeavors, ensuring that his fellow brothers keep their various heads on straight and their array of eyes on the task at hands. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_50926 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_50926 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Terri & Terry Perry When it comes to Terri and Terry, it's hard not to ask, “ Are two heads really better than one? ” These bickering brothers have little in common: Terri with an “ i ” is a real romantic who's quick to spot the silver lining in any situation, while older brother Terry with a “ y ” sports a more cynical outlook on life. If they can stop squabbling long enough to work with their Oozma Kappa brothers, they might be able to put their heads together-literally-and find their place in Monsters University's Scare Program once and for all. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_74427 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_74427 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Art The ultimate free spirit, Art is a mysterious monster with a questionable background. By far the strangest member of the Oozma Kappas, Art bowls over the competition-sometimes literally-with his unique dexterity and wild-card ways. Nothing is scarier than the unpredictable, especially when it comes to this furry ball of bad. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_100289 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_100289 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mrs. Squibbles Ms. Squibbles is a doting, single parent who encourages, accommodates, and more so, coddles her only son, Scott “ Squishy ” Squibbles. Squishy is 19 years old and still lives at home, but who can blame him? Ms. Squibbles is Monstropolis ’ best mom—she cooks for him, does his laundry; she even acts as house mom when he has his “ little friends ” over to play fraternity. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_129609 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_129609 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Oozma Kappa (OK) A collection of wholesome, good-natured misfits, the adorable brothers of Oozma Kappa (OK) have bonded over their inability to make it through the Scaring Program. With only four bodies in the house they don’t even have enough members to compete in the Scare Games, but what they lack in scariness and self-confidence they make up for in heart. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_161618 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_161618 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Roar Omega Roar (ROR) The Roar Omega Roar (ROR) fraternity is made up of the best of the best. They ’ re the smartest, most skilled, scariest monsters at Monsters University, and come from families with a long, proud history of scaring. While the RORs may be preppy in dress, they are ferocious in action and determined to always be on top no matter how ruthless they have to be. Self-declared as the most elite house on campus, the RORs are lead by President Johnny Worthington who presides over the house like an all-powerful monarch. Eager to continue their Scare Games winning streak, the RORs will do whatever it takes to stay on top. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_194497 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468886132781_194497 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Python Nu Kappa (PNK) Pretty in pink, the sisters of Python Nu Kappa (PNK) are not to be underestimated. Led by their fearless queen bee Carrie, these ladies are smart, cold-hearted and merciless. Covered in pink from head to toe, the PNKs sweet exterior quickly turns terrifying when the Scare Games begin. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468946765407_67508 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468946765407_67508 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Jaws Theta Chi (JOX) Big on brawn but short on brainpower, the Jaws Theta Chi (JOX) fraternity brothers are rarely seen without their flashy letterman jackets. The JOX are brutal competitors who never hesitate to do whatever it takes to beat their opponent, even if it’s breaking the rules. Despite practically living at the gym or on the field, these sports-loving monsters often prove that bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to scaring. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468946765407_107461 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468946765407_107461 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Eta Hiss Hiss (HSS) The Eta Hiss Hiss (HSS) sorority has been around since the beginning of Monsters University and the members are as mysterious as they are terrifying. The HSS sisters might be pale, mysterious and sullen but these intimidating Goth girls are fierce competitors and tough as nails. Fittingly, their most distinguished alumna is one of the most powerful, scary monsters on campus, who every new scare student strives to impress – Dean Hardscrabble. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_74358 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_74358 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Slugma Slugma Kappa (EEK) The athletic sisters of Slugma Slugma Kappa (EEK) spend most of their days working out and running drills to perfect their scaring skills. Their initiation is a triathlon, and training together 24/7 has strengthened the bonds of sisterhood so much so that these strong, self-assured girls are ready to out-work and out-scare any monster they encounter together. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_113231 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_113231 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Archie the Scare Pig The mascot to archrival school Fear Tech, Archie the Scare Pig is stolen by Sulley as a prank to get in with the Roar Omega Roars. However, Archie is no average pig. With six legs, and plenty of energy, Archie gives Mike and Sulley a run for their money. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_155463 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947483255_155463 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design The Monster Feel A big part of the fun in revisiting the Monsters world was figuring out what reads as “ University ” and finding ways to “monsterize” it. That means designing a world fit for monsters of all sizes. Architecture was created to give it that monster feel, so there are horns and teeth above the doors and windows. Even the trees have scales. College Days Monthropology Campus The Monsters University campus is huge, and was created to feel like there’s a new possibility around every corner, as life should feel at that age. It also contains some of the most incredible works of architecture ever made including the School of Scaring. Monumental and awe-inspiring, the School of Scaring is the centerpiece of MU. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_91627 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_91627 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Greek House Each Greek House at Monsters University reflects the attitude of the fraternity or sorority members living in it. Roar Omega Roar has history, Eta Hiss Hiss is more gothic, and Jaws Theta Chi is, as sets art director Robert Kondo puts it, \"as junky as possible without actually being disgusting.\" #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_110617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_110617 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Scare Games The Scare Games is an annual competition between the fraternities and sororities to prove who are the scariest monsters. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_127039 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_127039 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Field Trip One of the most pivotal scenes in the film is when the Oozma Kappas (OK) take a field trip, and sneak onto the premises of Monsters, Inc. Peering in through a window, they catch a glimpse of a scare floor where all of their heroes are performing actual scares. \"Whether they realize it or not,\" says Director Dan Scanlon, \"it's the first time [Mike and Sulley] start to see that they both want the same thing.\" #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_145143 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468947918906_145143 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Awards SCROLL DOWN Awards American Cinema Editors (ACE) Eddie Awards Best Edited Animated Feature Film NOMINee GREG SNYDER ASIFA-Hollywood Annie Awards Best Animated Feature Production NOMINEE Animated Effects in an Animated Production NOMINEEs Joshua Jenny Jason Johnston Matthew Wong Eric Froemling Enrique Vila Character ANIMATION in an Animated Feature Production NOMINEE John Chun Chiu Lee CHARACTER DESIGN IN AN ANIMATED FEATURE PRODUCTION NOMINEE: Chris Sasaki Music in an Animated Feature Production NOMINEE Randy Newman Production Design in an Animated Feature Production NOMINEEs: Ricky Nierva Robert Kondo Daisuke “Dice” Tsutsumi Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production WINNER Dean Kelly Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production NOMINEE Billy Crystal as the voice of Mike Writing in an Animated Feature Production NOMINEEs Daniel Gerson Robert L.

      "Inside Out Character Design World Design Awards Credits Inside Out SCROLL DOWN Inside Out Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it’s no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley’s main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Many Particles of Joy Joy is very bouncy, almost like a star. She’s full of life and energy, so filmmakers called on Effects Supervisor Gary Bruins and his team to figure out how to showcase that effervescence. “Pete [Docter] wanted Joy to have particles that radiate and shoot off her skin throughout the entire film,” says Bruins. “That meant creating an effect that would appear in hundreds and hundreds of shots. It had never been done before.” The Story of the Story Mixed Emotions Drawing With Your Inner Child Joy Joy ’ s goal has always been to make sure Riley stays happy. She is lighthearted, optimistic and determined to find the fun in every situation. Joy sees challenges in Riley ’ s life as opportunities, and the less happy moments as hiccups on the way back to something great. As long as Riley is happy, so is Joy. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_13300 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_13300 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sadness None of the other Emotions really understand what Sadness’s role is. Sadness would love to be more optimistic and helpful in keeping Riley happy, but she finds it so hard to be positive. Sometimes it seems like the best thing to do is just lie on the floor and have a good cry. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_27478 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_27478 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Anger Anger feels very passionately about making sure things are fair for Riley. He has a fiery spirit and tends to explode (literally) when things don’t go as planned. He is quick to overreact and has little patience for life’s imperfections. #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_45103 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_21_1468878312721_45103 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Disgust Disgust is highly opinionated, extremely honest and prevents Riley from getting poisoned – both physically and socially. She keeps a careful eye on the people, places and things that Riley comes into contact with – whether that’s broccoli or last year’s fashion trend. Disgust always has the best of intentions and refuses to lower her standards. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1489699878783_31798 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1489699878783_31798 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Fear Fear’s main job is to protect Riley and keep her safe. He is constantly on the lookout for potential disasters, and spends time evaluating the possible dangers, pitfalls and risk involved in Riley’s everyday activities. There are very few activities and events that Fear does not find to be dangerous and possibly fatal. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_21119 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_21119 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Riley Riley Andersen is an eternally happy kid, at least until she turns eleven and her dad gets a job across the country, forcing the family to relocate to San Francisco. As she struggles to navigate a new home and school, Riley experiences an unfamiliar mix of emotions. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_59452 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_59452 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bing Bong With the trunk of an elephant, the tail of a cat, and body of cotton candy, Bing Bong is Riley ’ s imaginary friend. (You have to remember, when Riley was three animals were all the rage.) Unfortunately, he ’ s been out of work since Riley turned four, and he ’ s desperate to not be left behind as Riley grows up. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_102678 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_102678 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Mom and Dad With a new job and a brand new city, Riley’s Mom and Dad find themselves dealing with the ever-changing emotions of their once happy daughter. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_140714 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_140714 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Mind vs Brain “The film takes place in the mind, not the brain,” says Director Pete Docter. “We were very specific from the get-go. We didn’t want blood vessels and dendrites. The mind is metaphorical. We imagined our thought processes, memories, feelings.” But according to Daniel Holland, sets art director, the team used the physiology as reference. “We were inspired by shapes—the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, cells under a microscope,” he says. “Everything was heavily caricatured, but we wanted to start from somewhere that made sense.” Abstract Thought Mapping The Mind Headquarters Headquarters is the control center in Riley’s mind where all five Emotions live and work, monitoring Riley’s day-to-day experiences and guiding her along the way. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_211317 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_211317 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Dream Productions Built and staffed like a full-fledged Hollywood studio, Dream Productions is where Riley ’ s dreams (and nightmares) are created. The writers here are not afraid to take risks and often dance on the edge of logic when it comes to Riley ’ s dreams. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_231770 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_231770 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Imagination Land “Imagination Land is where all of Riley ’ s flights of fancy and daydreams are built full-size and come to life, ” says Docter. “ It ’ s a place where you go to play. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_251470 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_251470 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Islands Of Personality Riley ’ s Islands of Personality are powered by core memories, which are memories of extremely significant times in Riley ’ s life. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_269333 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468881055471_269333 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Train Of Thought The Train of Thought is an all-terrain choo-choo with a self-generating track that delivers daydreams, ideas and other thoughts to Headquarters. It ’ s also used to transfer memories to different regions of Riley ’ s mind.

      "The Good Dinosaur Character Design World Design Awards Credits The Good Dinosaur SCROLL DOWN The Good Dinosaur The Good Dinosaur asks the question: What if the asteroid that forever changed life on Earth missed the planet completely and giant dinosaurs never became extinct? Pixar takes you on an epic journey into the world of dinosaurs where an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend. While traveling through a harsh and mysterious landscape, Arlo learns the power of confronting his fears and discovers what he is truly capable of. Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Life Size Dinosaur According to Production Designer Harley Jessup, the filmmakers did a deep dive into what’s known about the size of a real Apatosaurus in an effort to add authenticity to Arlo and his family. “We created a life-size printout of Arlo to help imagine his gigantic scale,” says Jessup. “Arlo is 18 feet tall and weighs about 6 tons, and Poppa, at 46 feet, is taller than the Steve Jobs Building on Pixar’s campus. We exaggerated the size of the T-Rexes for our story, and they range from 38 to 50 feet tall, with Butch weighing in at about 45 tons. Every Part Of The Dinosaur A Filmmakers Journey Arlo The last to hatch among his siblings, 11-year-old Arlo has yet to make his mark on his family’s farm. Though he is eager to help out with chores, this sheltered Apatosaurus just can’t seem to get past his fear of everything. #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1468866773485_11547 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_4_1468866773485_11547 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Spot Spot is a wild, tough and tenacious human boy who has lived alone in the wilderness for much of his life. He speaks in only grunts and growls, but his strengths are clear: he’s fearless and confident. #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1468866773485_13425 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_6_1468866773485_13425 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Poppa Brave and selfless, Poppa is a devoted husband and father, working tirelessly to make a life for his family on their farm. He has a soft spot for Arlo, his small and fearful son, and takes special care of him as he grows up. #block-yui_3_17_2_8_1468866773485_37400 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_8_1468866773485_37400 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Momma A loving wife and mother, Momma is smart and quick-witted. She’s a hard worker with a lot of love for her family, and she keeps her children and their farm in order. Her quiet strength is the backbone of the family. #block-yui_3_17_2_10_1468866773485_22561 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_10_1468866773485_22561 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Buck & Libby Buck is Arlo ’ s brother: they ’ re the same age, but Buck is bigger, stronger and a little rambunctious. Arlo's sister Libby is a capable and willful girl who can plow a mean field. “ We wanted Buck and Libby to be more capable, more brave than Arlo, ” says Story Supervisor Kelsey Mann. “ Everything comes more easily, despite the fact that they ’ re all the same age. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_12_1468866773485_35813 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_12_1468866773485_35813 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Pet Collector Pet Collector is a mysterious Styracosaurus who lives in the wilderness. Like Arlo, he harbors unreasonable fears. His ability to blend into his surroundings helps—along with an unusual (but not exactly fierce) collection of forest critters he’s recruited to protect him. #block-yui_3_17_2_14_1468866773485_30648 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_14_1468866773485_30648 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Butch According to production designer Harley Jessup, the filmmakers did a deep dive into what ’ s known about the size of a real Apatosaurus in an effort to add authenticity to Arlo and his family. “ We created a life-size printout of Arlo to help imagine his gigantic scale, ” says Jessup. “ Arlo is 18 feet tall and weighs about 6 tons, and Poppa, at 46 feet, is taller than the main building at Pixar. We exaggerated the size of the T-Rexes for our story, and they range from 38 to 50 feet tall, with Butch weighing in at about 45 tons. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1468866773485_33186 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_16_1468866773485_33186 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Nash & Ramsey Nash, who isn’t the sharpest of spurs and has trouble keeping track of their herd, exhibits a mischievous charm and positive attitude that makes him good company out on the range. Ramsey loves the challenge of driving a herd of longhorns with her father, Butch, and her little brother Nash. Ramsey has a lively, outgoing personality—she likes good jokes, tells a mean story and has a soft spot for those in need. #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_32256 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_32256 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Pterodactyls The Pterodactyls are a search-and-“rescue\" team of five. They like to sit back and let the often-treacherous storms in this part of the world do their dirty work, then reap the benefits of the devastation. #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_93587 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_93587 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Raptors Raptors prey on the prized herd of longhorns that belong to Butch and his Tyrannosaurus Rex family. Raptors—or Rustlers, as Butch calls them—sport wiry, feathered bodies and hardly compare in size or strength to a T-Rex. But as a group, the Raptors pose quite a threat, and even a T-Rex may need to call in reinforcements before tangling with them. #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_225970 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_20_1468866773485_225970 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Environments The Filmmakers wanted to capture the full scope of the environments they researched. According to Production Designer Harley Jessup, their experiences in the American Northwest not only illustrated nature’s power, but also its beauty. “The area has a fantastic variety of landscapes, ranging from the Jackson Valley and the Tetons to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in Yellowstone. We studied the grasslands of Montana and the mesas in Wyoming’s Red Desert, then incorporated all of it in Arlo’s journey.” Creating A World Researching The Ranch Just Listen The River “The river became the vehicle that would take Arlo hundreds of miles away from home, where he wakes up and begins his life quest,” says Director Peter Sohn. “That same river becomes the yellow brick road back to Arlo’s family. And that simple concept became our basic structure: he gets washed away in first act and then fights his way home throughout the second and third acts.\" #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_19023 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_19023 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Forest & Mountains Their awe of nature ’ s beauty and power inspired the filmmakers to make the wilderness a character in itself and not just a setting for Arlo and Spot. “ The golds and reds from the aspens were incredible—and the cottonwoods—I ’ ve never seen anything like that before, ” says Director Peter Sohn. “ The landscape is so huge. It makes you feel tiny. There ’ s such a simplicity to the graphic nature of the place that it felt perfect for making a giant animal like a dinosaur feel small. ” #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_35720 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_35720 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Homestead Arlo’s home, a simple ranch nestled in the plains, is the heart of his long journey home. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_53176 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1468878312721_53176 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Plains Their awe of nature’s beauty and power inspired the filmmakers to make the wilderness a character in itself and not just a setting for Arlo and Spot.

      "Finding Dory Character Design World Design Awards Credits Finding Dory SCROLL DOWN Finding Dory Forgetful blue tang Dory is living happily in the reef with Marlin and Nemo. When Dory suddenly remembers that she has a family out there who may be looking for her, the trio takes off on a life-changing adventure across the ocean to California’s prestigious Marine Life Institute , a rehabilitation center and aquarium. In an effort to find her mom and dad, Dory enlists the help of three of the MLI’s most intriguing residents: Hank, a cantankerous “septopus\" who frequently gives employees the slip; Bailey, a beluga whale who is convinced his biological sonar skills are on the fritz; and Destiny, a nearsighted whale shark. Deftly navigating the complex inner workings of the MLI, Dory and her friends discover the magic within their flaws, friendships and family. Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design The Master Mimic A mimic octopus, the inspiration for Hank, has the ability to ward off predators by mimicking other creatures (like a sea snake, flatfish or lionfish) . Likewise, it can camouflage itself against its background, from jagged coral to a sandy sea bottom. It can streamline its body and fold into itself. Its arms are covered in hundreds of suckers, which have the ability to attach to almost any surface, giving the animal unmatched mobility, as well as an uncanny ability to manipulate items like the lid of a jar. Dory Dory is a bright blue tang with a sunny personality. She suffers from short-term memory loss, which normally doesn’t upset her upbeat attitude—until she realizes she’s forgotten something big: her family. She’s found a new family in Marlin and Nemo, but she’s haunted by the belief that someone out there is looking for her. Dory may have trouble recalling exactly what—or who—she’s searching for, but she won’t give up until she uncovers her past and discovers something else along the way: self-acceptance. #block-yui_3_17_2_9_1469576925637_39710 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_9_1469576925637_39710 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Nemo & Marlin Dory is on a mission to the California coast to track down her family, and Marlin and Nemo are there to help her. Nemo may just be a young clownfish with a lucky fin, but he wholeheartedly believes in Dory. After all, he understands what it’s like to be different. And Marlin, who of course knows how it feels to lose family, realizes he has no choice but to pack up his nervous energy and skepticism and embark on yet another adventure, this time to help his friend in need. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_57404 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_57404 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Hank Hank is an octopus. Actually, he’s a “septopus”: he lost a tentacle—along with his sense of humor—somewhere along the way. But Hank is just as competent as his eight-armed peers. An accomplished escape artist with camouflaging capabilities to boot, Hank is the first to greet Dory when she finds herself in the Marine Life Institute. But make no mistake: he’s not looking for a friend. Hank is after one thing—a ticket on a transport truck to a cozy Cleveland facility where he’ll be able to enjoy a peaceful life of solitude. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_72147 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_72147 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Bailey Bailey is the Marine Life Institute’s resident beluga whale who is convinced his biological sonar skills are on the fritz. The good news—or bad news, depending on who you ask—is that doctors at the MLI can’t seem to find anything wrong with him. Bailey’s flair for the dramatic never ceases to push his neighbor’s buttons: whale shark Destiny can’t seem to get through to him, no matter how hard she tries. Maybe he’ll listen to new friend Dory, who seems to be full of crazy ideas. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_90032 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_90032 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Destiny Destiny may be a clumsy swimmer, but she has a big heart. She has a big everything, actually—whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea. Destiny resides in the Marine Life Institute, where one day an oddly familiar blue tang named Dory falls into her pool. Destiny is admittedly embarrassed by her obvious lack of grace, a product of poor eyesight, but Dory thinks she swims beautifully. And Dory is delighted to learn that her supersized friend speaks whale, too. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_106301 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_106301 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Becky Becky is an offbeat, kooky loon who takes a liking to Marlin.

Marlin and Nemo find them snoozing on a warm—and highly coveted—rock just outside the facility. These sea lions really enjoy their down time and would rather not be bothered mid nap—but their bark is far worse than their bite. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_153072 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469642088169_153072 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Otters Otters are seriously cute.

Whether someone is on the reef, in the open ocean or the aquarium, the water can run more green, or more blue, depending on the sequence. Inside the Marine Life Institute, the water actually becomes a light source. Humans tend to fall into silhouettes in the background and the water really underscores that this is a story about a fish. Great Barrier Reef The Great Barrier Reef ’ s vibrantly colored coral and seaweed provide a fun and friendly home for Marlin, Nemo and the newest member of their family, Dory. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469644990851_62565 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469644990851_62565 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Marine Life Institute The “Jewel of Morro Bay”—the Marine Life Institute (MLI), is a rescue and rehabilitation center and premiere aquarium. #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469644990851_89304 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_2_1469644990851_89304 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Shipping Lanes The Shipping Lanes are a stark and foreboding wasteland of shipwrecked vessels and shipping containers.

      "Cars 3 Character Design World Design Credits Cars 3 SCROLL DOWN Cars 3 Cars 3 Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician with her own plan to win, inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet, and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage! Trailers Character Design SCROLL DOWN Character Design NASCAR Research To explore what was next for Lightning McQueen filmmakers consulted NASCAR veterans, including four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and Ray Evernham, who served as Gordon’s crew chief for three of his championships. Gordon proved to be a key resource. “He talked a lot about how young racers are full of energy,” says co-producer Andrea Warren. “They like to go fast and hard, while a more experienced driver knows he doesn’t have to do that. They get to know the game well enough that they can play it in a different way.” “We did a lot of research,” says director Brian Fee. “We looked at athletes in other sports, but really focused on NASCAR drivers. They start at such an early age and their lives are centered around driving. We even talked to a sports psychologist who explained that many of these drivers can’t imagine doing anything else.” Lightning McQueen Lightning McQueen is a world-champion racer who’s riding high with five Piston-Cup wins under his hood. Suddenly, he finds himself faced with a new generation of racers who threaten not only his dominance in the sport—but the confidence that got him there. Determined to get back into the pole position, #95 must decide if his love for racing is enough to fuel the comeback of his life. “We were really intrigued by what happens to athletes who are in the twilight of their careers,” says director Brian Fee. “All Lightning McQueen has ever wanted is to be a champion—and he’s done that. Does that mean his life is over? He doesn’t know anything else.” #block-2e0caad33a14f65c9dd2 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-2e0caad33a14f65c9dd2 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Cruz Ramirez Cruz Ramirez is a tech-savvy, unconventional trainer at the Rust-eze Racing Center. She expertly arms the team’s talented rookies with cutting-edge tools to tear up the track—but she nearly stalls when Piston-Cup champion Lightning McQueen shows up. While she’d love to help him find his way back to the top, she knows the competition is faster than ever, and victory is all about speed—or is it? #block-c42c5b7e7e9abba2a981 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-c42c5b7e7e9abba2a981 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Jackson Storm Jackson Storm is fast, sleek and ready to win. A front-runner in the next generation of racers, Storm’s quiet confidence and cocky demeanor are off-putting—but his unmatched speed threatens to redefine the sport. Trained on high-tech simulators that are programmed to perfect technique and maximize velocity, Jackson Storm is literally built to be unbeatable—and he knows it. “Jackson Storm epitomizes the next-gen racers,” says Armie Hammer, who voices the character. “They’re young, brash and confident. Jackson Storm is newer and faster. He can calculate the drag coefficient on the spot. It’s hard to compete with that.” #block-f5febec09a750a029974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-f5febec09a750a029974 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Smokey Former Piston Cup team owner Smokey teamed up with the Fabulous Hudson Hornet back in the ‘50s. His gruff exterior and strong opinions served him well as crew chief—and he owns what’s arguably the best dang garage in town. He still wrestles with trusting his head or his gut, but when it comes to his friends—he’s all heart. #block-8cbc9535fde0113bd490 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-8cbc9535fde0113bd490 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Junior \"Midnight\" Moon Piston-Cup legend Junior “Midnight” Moon got his start running homemade “fuel” through the wooded back roads with only the moon to light the way. #block-ef982ba45cd2e1e0d1ca .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-ef982ba45cd2e1e0d1ca .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } River Scott River Scott came from modest beginnings, but his hard drive and never-quit attitude made him a trailblazer in the Piston Cup—racking up seven circuit wins in the early ‘50s. Scrappy and improvisational, Scott wore his dents proudly. #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_56430 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_56430 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Louise Nash Known as the “First Lady of Racing,” Louise “Barnstormer” Nash didn’t have an easy start as one of the first and only females in racing—she had to steal her racing number to compete in her first race. But her fearless driving style soon won her the respect of every car she raced. Nash took on the Fabulous Hudson Hornet in the early days of the Piston Cup, winning three back-to-back races. #block-5f03e970b4d7cda676ec .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-5f03e970b4d7cda676ec .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Veterans “Cars 3” also welcomes back Lightning McQueen’s gang of friends from Radiator Springs, including Lightning’s best buddy Mater, and #95’s No. 1 fan Sally. Friends supporting their hometown hero include Fillmore, Sarge, Lizzie, Ramon, Sheriff and Flo. Loyal transporter Mack, big-hearted Italian Fiat 500 Luigi, and charming little Italian forklift Guido continue to support Lightning McQueen’s racing endeavors. World-renowned sports announcer Bob Cutlass is still calling the races, and Chick Hicks is back—this time as a commentator on the Racing Sports Network. The lovable duo Dusty and Rusty return as Rust-eze’s chief proprietors—though they have big things in store for Lightning McQueen. The late Paul Newman can be heard in the film reprising his role as The Fabulous Hudson Hornet aka Doc Hudson. When Newman recorded for the original “Cars,” he and director John Lasseter often exchanged thoughts on racing between takes. The conversations were fortunately captured, proving invaluable to filmmakers who wanted to reignite Lightning McQueen’s love of the sport and the mentor who helped him discover it in the first place. “Paul was a big fan of racing and really knowledgeable,” says producer Kevin Reher. “I think we all learned a little about the sport from Doc Hudson.” #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_235738 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_235738 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Miss Fritter Miss Fritter loves the smash-and-crash life of demolition derby. A local legend at the Thunder Hollow Speedway, Fritter’s formidable school-bus size is intimidating, but it’s her smokestacks of doom, razor-sharp stop sign and crazy collection of her victims’ license plates that usually steer her opponents in the other direction. #block-25adcd78eab6fa5e70cd .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-25adcd78eab6fa5e70cd .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Sterling Sterling is a brilliant “business car” who runs Rust-eze Racing Center—one of the most successful elite training facilities in the country. Despite his dapper appearance and obvious wealth, Sterling comes across as unassuming and laid-back. But business is business, and Sterling is driven to ensure all of his investments pay off. #block-bfa20e488d7899382a08 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-bfa20e488d7899382a08 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Natalie Certain Natalie Certain is a highly respected statistical analyst who knows her numbers. Book-smart and mathematically gifted, Certain is a fresh voice in the racing world. While she may earn top marks in her ability to evaluate a racer’s stats, she could be underestimating the importance of determination. “She’s a confident, intelligent woman,” says directing animator Jude Brownbill. “Her movements are kind of sharp without feeling too weightless. There’s not much flourish, yet she’s still graceful. She’s all about the facts, so she’s very focused and direct.” #block-d693c26bb7b6532e51f3 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-d693c26bb7b6532e51f3 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } World Design SCROLL DOWN World Design Hyperreal According to director Brian Fee, the “Cars” films have a look that separates them from the rest of Pixar’s library. “While all of our films are stylized in their own way, the ‘Cars’ films want to be more photorealistic—almost hyperreal; it’s art directed realism. With the technology we’ve implemented in the last few years, we have the ability to make these characters and sets feel more real and alive than ever before.” “This is a world we believe exists,” says production designer Bill Cone. “It’s familiar. The term we use is believability, which is the basis for everything we do. The world of ‘Cars’ is built to accommodate its car-sized population. It is stylized. We’ve played with some metaphorical elements—cars see themselves in nature the way man sees himself in nature. It’s all done in a way that is as relatable as it is compelling.” Radiator Springs Although Lightning McQueen ventures far from home in an effort to rediscover what makes him a great racer, his heart will always be in Radiator Springs. But it’s been a few years since his hometown last saw the big screen. “We had to upgrade it a little,” says production designer Bill Cone. “The rest of the world will have the kind of detail we’re capable of achieving now, so we needed to bring Radiator Springs into the same movie.” #block-82f3188ad7ec1c36aff5 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-82f3188ad7ec1c36aff5 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } The Rust-eze Training Center The Rust-eze Training Center is a state-of-the-art facility with high-tech equipment. “We started with the size and shape of an airplane hangar,” says Production Designer Bill Cone. “And we filled it with all of the gadgets and tools a modern racer would want: simulators, treadmills, a yoga room.” The production designer says the facility was inspired by boutique manufacturers in Europe. “Everything is unbelievably spotless—like a hospital,” Cone says. “You could eat off the floor.” #block-51bb8545ac3fcd3aa37a .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-51bb8545ac3fcd3aa37a .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Thomasville When Lightning McQueen realizes that high-tech training may not be the key to his renewed success, he’s inspired to track down the coach who trained his mentor, Doc Hudson. He finds himself in Thomasville, where former crew chief Smokey runs an old-school garage. “Doc grew up in Thomasville—he actually raced his first race there,” says sets art director Noah Klocek. “We took research trips to the South where NASCAR got its start, spending some time in northern Georgia and South Carolina.” #block-5d1d3114d3c22ec78ce3 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-5d1d3114d3c22ec78ce3 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Crazy 8 Demolition Derby Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez yearn to take part in a down-and-dirty race to reignite the passion Lightning’s lost. Unfortunately, they end up in the midst of a Crazy 8—which is certainly dirty. To achieve the right look and feel for the sequence, filmmakers actually went to a night race that took place on a dirt track. “They were covered in dirt,” says Cone. “It was inspiring.” #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_378434 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_378434 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Florida International Super Speedway The film features several races across the country—and filmmakers added details to make sure each track had a distinctive personality. But the final race in the film that takes place in Florida was a culmination of Lightning McQueen’s journey—so it had to be special. “We were tasked with creating a racetrack that really embraced modernism,” says sets art director Noah Klocek. “It represents what Jackson Storm and all the rest of the next-gen racers are bringing to the sport.” #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_420133 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_3_1496676507028_420133 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } Credits SCROLL DOWN Credits DIRECTED BY Brian Fee PRODUCED BY Kevin Reher, p.g.a.

Most of their work takes place during the development of a project, when we’re working out the story and the look of the film. The wealth of beautiful art created for each movie is rarely seen outside the studio, and the finished film we send around the world would never be possible without it. Computer animation is both an extraordinarily liberating and extraordinarily challenging medium. While it contains no limits except those that you choose for yourself, it also contains nothing, down to the smallest detail, that you do not create yourself. You get nothing for free. There are never any lucky accidents in the computer, only hard-won victories. So the development stage, the time before we build our digital world, is the time when we’re most free. We encourage our artists to explore as much as possible, to give their imaginations free rein. In turn, their art inspires our storytellers and filmmakers to new heights. In the early days of computer animation, people used to ask us if the computer made the film. Fortunately, we’ve come a long way since then. It’s been deeply gratifying to have our medium recognized for the art form that it is. In the more than ten years since the Museum of Modern Art in New York premiered Pixar: 20 Years of Animation , the exhibition has traveled around the world, throughout Europe, East Asia, Latin America, and Australia. It’s been wonderful to bring this inside look at the studio to so many different countries and to see how enthusiastically everyone has greeted the work of our talented artists. We’re very proud to present this exhibition, marking Pixar’s tricennial anniversary in 2016. Pixar: 30 Years of Animation showcases artwork from each of our films—from our early short films and Toy Story through Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur . We’re incredibly proud of Pixar’s many talented artists, and we’re thrilled to present their work to you.
