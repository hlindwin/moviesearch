Adapted from Nick Flynn&rsquo;s 2004 memoir <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Another Bulls&mdash;t Night in Suck City<\\/span>, the movie explores bonds both unbreakable and fragile between parent and child.<!-- pagebreak --><\\/p><p>Nick Flynn (portrayed in the film by Paul Dano of <em>Little Miss Sunshine<\\/em> and <em>There Will Be Blood<\\/em>) is a young writer seeking to define himself. He misses his late mother, Jody (four-time Academy Award nominee Julianne Moore), and her loving nature. But his father, Jonathan, is not even a memory, as Nick has not seen the man in 18 years.<\\/p><p>Jonathan Flynn (two-time Academy Award winner Robert De Niro) has long defined himself as a great writer,<strong> <\\/strong>&ldquo;a master storyteller.&rdquo; After abandoning his wife and child, Jonathan scrapes through life on his own terms, and ends up serving time in prison for cashing forged checks. After prison, he drives a cab for a number of years, but with his drinking and eccentricities now accelerating, he loses his job. Despite the occasional grandiose letter to his son, he has remained absent from Nick&rsquo;s life.<\\/p><p>Suddenly facing eviction from his apartment, Jonathan impulsively reaches out to Nick and the two come face-to-face. The older man is eloquent and formidable; overwhelmed, Nick nonetheless prepares to integrate his father into his own life. But, as quickly as he materialized, Jonathan flits away again.<\\/p><p>Moving on, Nick takes a job at a homeless shelter, where he learns from Captain (Wes Studi) and Joy (Lili Taylor) how to relate to the guests who arrive night after night. Seeing the homeless &ndash; some permanently, some temporarily so &ndash; and hearing their stories, Nick finds purpose in his own life and work. He also sustains a romance with a co-worker, Denise (Olivia Thirlby). Then one night, Jonathan arrives, seeking a bed, and Nick&rsquo;s senses of self and compassion falter. To give the two of them a shot at a real future, Nick will have to decide whom to seek redemption for first.<\\/p><p>Evocatively told, ruefully funny, and moving in its depiction of the ties that bind, <em><strong>Being Flynn<\\/strong><\\/em> tells a story that reveals universal truths.<\\/p>\",\"in_theaters\":\"<p>March 2, 2012<\\/p>\",\"date_release\":\"2012-03-02\",\"division\":\"focus_features\",\"logo\":\"\",\"rating_img\":\"\",\"show_grid\":0,\"show_grid_filters\":0,\"show_in_theaters\":0,\"show_awards_intro\":0,\"meta_title\":\"Being Flynn Movie | Official Website | Buy Now | Focus Features\",\"meta_desc\":\"A young writer, Nick (portrayed by Paul Dano), takes a job at a homeless shelter - where one night he discovers his long-absent father Jonathan (two-time Academy Award winner Robert De Niro) seeking a bed.\",\"meta_keywords\":\"Being Flynn Film,buy Being Flynn DVD,buy Being Flynn Blu-Ray,Paul Weitz\",\"meta_img\":\"http:\\/\\/focusmicrosites.s3.amazonaws.com\\/assets\\/img\\/og-meta.png\",\"facebook\":\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/FocusFeatures\\/\",\"twitter\":\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/FocusFeatures\",\"instagram\":\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/focusfeatures\\/\",\"youtube_channel\":\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/user\\/FocusFeatures\",\"tumblr_url\":\"\",\"dvd_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Being-Flynn-Robert-Niro\\/dp\\/B007VYE4PK\\/ref=sr_1_2_twi_dvd_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1484684494&sr=8-2&keywords=Being+Flynn+Movie\",\"bluray_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Being-Flynn-Blu-ray-Robert-Niro\\/dp\\/B00BMTTXYM\\/ref=tmm_blu_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1484684494&sr=8-2\",\"ondemand_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.uphe.com\\/movies\\/being-flynn\",\"itunes_url\":\"https:\\/\\/itunes.apple.com\\/us\\/movie\\/being-flynn\\/id533031149\",\"moviefone_id\":\"\",\"movietickets_id\":\"\",\"fandango_id\":\"\",\"related_film_title\":null,\"related_film_url\":\"http:\\/\\/focusfeatures.com\\/\",\"related_film_thumb\":\"\",\"code_head\":\"\",\"code_body_top\":\"\",\"code_body_bottom\":\"\",\"theme_colors\":\"\",\"theme_fonts\":\"\",\"theme_hl\":\"57,148,209\",\"theme_bg\":\"\",\"intro_video_id\":0,\"categories\":[],\"gallery\":[],\"backgrounds\":[],\"modules\":[{\"module_id\":\"3\",\"title\":\"OWN IT\",\"alignment\":\"left\"},{\"module_id\":\"7\",\"title\":\"SOCIAL\",\"alignment\":\"right\"}],\"news\":[],\"partners\":[],\"reactions\":[],\"trending\":[],\"castcrew\":[{\"id\":\"4026\",\"full_name\":\"Robert De Niro\",\"person_role\":\"Jonathan Flynn\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4028\",\"full_name\":\"Paul  Dano\",\"person_role\":\"Nick Flynn\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4030\",\"full_name\":\"Olivia Thirlby\",\"person_role\":\"Denise\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4032\",\"full_name\":\"Lili Taylor\",\"person_role\":\"Joy\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4034\",\"full_name\":\"Wes Studi\",\"person_role\":\"Captain\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4036\",\"full_name\":\"Julianne  Moore\",\"person_role\":\"Jody Flynn\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4025\",\"full_name\":\"Paul Weitz\",\"person_role\":\"Director\\/Screenplay; Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4027\",\"full_name\":\"Nick Flynn\",\"person_role\":\"Author; Executive Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4029\",\"full_name\":\"Andrew Miano\",\"person_role\":\"Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4031\",\"full_name\":\"Michael Costigan\",\"person_role\":\"Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4033\",\"full_name\":\"Jane Rosenthal\",\"person_role\":\"Executive Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4035\",\"full_name\":\"Meghan Lyvers\",\"person_role\":\"Executive Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4037\",\"full_name\":\"Kerry Kohansky\",\"person_role\":\"Executive Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4038\",\"full_name\":\"Caroline Baron\",\"person_role\":\"Executive Producer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4039\",\"full_name\":\"Declan Quinn, , ASC\",\"person_role\":\"Director of Photography\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4040\",\"full_name\":\"Sarah Knowles\",\"person_role\":\"Production Designer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4041\",\"full_name\":\"Joan Sobel, ACE\",\"person_role\":\"Editor\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4042\",\"full_name\":\"Badly Drawn Boy\",\"person_role\":\"Music\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"},{\"id\":\"4043\",\"full_name\":\"Aude Bronson-Howard\",\"person_role\":\"Costume Designer\",\"url\":\"\",\"is_cast\":\"0\"}],\"awards\":[]},\"spriteVersion\":\"13\",\"cssVersion\":\"118.13\",\"jsVersion\":\"117.13\",\"jsonPath\":\"http:\\/\\/focusmicrosites.s3.amazonaws.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/_tmp\\/productionsbeing_flynn\",\"status\":\"ok\",\"usedDB\":0}}"], "url": "focusfeatures.com/being_flynn", "_type": "x"}
