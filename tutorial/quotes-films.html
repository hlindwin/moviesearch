Though they initially seem completely at odds, the pair bond over Lily's contempt for her oppressive stepfather, Mark, and as their friendship grows, they begin to bring out one another's most destructive tendencies.

In the summer of 1976, an Air France jet traveling from Tel Aviv to Paris is taken over in midair by four hijackers; two Palestinians and two left-wing German radicals. When the plane is diverted to an abandoned terminal at Entebbe Airport in Uganda, the terrified passengers become bargaining chips in a deadly political standoff. As the likelihood of finding a diplomatic solution fades, the Israeli government sets in motion an extraordinary plan to free the prisoners before time runs out.

When Dustin Noble (John Krasinski), a slick environmental activist, arrives, suddenly the stakes, both personal and professional, rise to the boiling point.<\/p>","in_theaters":"<p>December 28, 2012<\/p>","date_results":"OWN IT NOW","date_ob":"2012-12-28","production_status":3,"color":"#1887c7","color2":"","trailer_url":"","fandango_id":"","other_ticket":"","ticketing_desc":"","poster":"","footer_img":"","grid_img":"http:\/\/focusmicrosites.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/uploads\/filmgrid_1477409606.jpg","hasposts":1,"columns":1,"rank":70,"division":"focus_features"},{"id":"hyde_park_on_hudson","num_id":97,"production_title":"Hyde Park on Hudson","short_desc":"<p>Academy Award nominees Bill Murray and Laura Linney star in a historical tale that uniquely explores the all-too-human side of one of&nbsp;history&rsquo;s&nbsp;iconic leaders.

The film marks the third collaboration of the director with Academy Award-nominated actress Keira Knightley and Academy Award-nominated producers Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, and Paul Webster, following their award-winning box office successes&nbsp;<em>Pride &amp; Prejudice<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Atonement<\/em>.<\/p><p>The creative team also includes cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (<em>The Avengers<\/em>), three-time Academy Award-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood (<em>Sherlock Holmes<\/em>), film editor Melanie Ann Oliver (<em>Jane Eyre<\/em>), hair and make-up designer Ivana Primorac (<em>Hanna<\/em>), Academy Award-winning composer Dario Marianelli (<em>Atonement<\/em>), and two-time Academy Award-nominated costume designer Jacqueline Durran (<em>Pride &amp; Prejudice<\/em>). The timeless story powerfully explores the capacity for love that surges through the human heart, while illuminating the lavish society that was imperial Russia. The time is 1874. Vibrant and beautiful, Anna Karenina (Ms. Knightley) has what any of her contemporaries would aspire to; she is the wife of Karenin (Jude Law), a high-ranking government official to whom she has borne a son, and her social standing in St. Petersburg could scarcely be higher. She journeys to Moscow after a letter from her philandering brother Oblonsky (Matthew Macfadyen) arrives, asking for Anna to come and help save his marriage to Dolly (Kelly Macdonald). En route, Anna makes the acquaintance of Countess Vronsky (Olivia Williams), who is then met at the train station by her son, the dashing cavalry officer Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). When Anna is introduced to Vronsky, there is a mutual spark of instant attraction that cannot &ndash; and will not &ndash; be ignored.<\/p><p>The Moscow household is also visited by Oblonsky&rsquo;s best friend Levin (Domhnall Gleeson), an overly sensitive and compassionate landowner. Levin is in love with Dolly&rsquo;s younger sister Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Inopportunely, he proposes to Kitty but she is infatuated with Vronsky. Devastated, Levin returns to his Pokrovskoe estate and throws himself into farm work. Kitty herself is heartbroken when, at a grand ball, Vronsky only has eyes for Anna and the married woman reciprocates the younger man&rsquo;s interest.<\/p><p>Anna struggles to regain her equilibrium by rushing home to St. Petersburg, where Vronsky follows her. She attempts to resume her familial&nbsp;routine,&nbsp;but is consumed by thoughts of Vronsky. A passionate affair ensues, which scandalizes St. Petersburg society. Karenin is placed in an untenable position and is forced to give his wife an ultimatum. In attempting to attain happiness, the decisions Anna makes pierce the veneer of an image-obsessed society, reverberating with romantic and tragic consequences that dramatically change her and the lives of all around her.<\/p>","in_theaters":"<p>November 16, 2012<\/p>","date_results":"OWN IT NOW","date_ob":"2012-11-16","production_status":3,"color":"#e03c34","color2":"","trailer_url":"","fandango_id":"","other_ticket":"","ticketing_desc":"","poster":"","footer_img":"","grid_img":"http:\/\/focusmicrosites.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/uploads\/filmgrid_1477409500.jpg","hasposts":1,"columns":1,"rank":72,"division":"focus_features"},{"id":"half_revolution","num_id":104,"production_title":"1\/2 Revolution","short_desc":"","in_theaters":"October 9, 2012","date_results":"OWN IT NOW","date_ob":"2012-10-09","production_status":3,"color":"","color2":"","trailer_url":"","fandango_id":"","other_ticket":"","ticketing_desc":"","poster":"","footer_img":"","grid_img":"","hasposts":0,"columns":1,"rank":73,"division":"focus_world"},{"id":"for_a_good_time_call","num_id":99,"production_title":"For A Good Time, Call...","short_desc":"<p>Love and friendship are on the line in&nbsp;<strong><em>For a Good Time, Call&hellip;<\/em><\/strong>, directed by Jamie Travis from an original screenplay by Katie Anne Naylon &amp; Lauren Anne Miller.

Ted and Sylvia were a sensual, volatile, and brilliant married couple who emerged as two of the most influential writers of the 20th century.<\/p><p>The film begins in 1956. Sylvia is in England on a Fulbright Scholarship when she meets Ted. The attraction is immediate and mutual. It is a meeting not only of the&nbsp;minds,&nbsp;but of an intense physicality as well. Within four months, they are married. When her studies are completed, Sylvia is offered a teaching post back in America. She accepts, and the couple relocates. A working wife, Sylvia must also tend to her unique voice or risk losing it. The newly published Ted attracts the attention of the literary world, along with the attentions of admiring women. Returning to England in late 1959, Sylvia and Ted attempt to renew their commitment, first with the birth of one child and then another. But as the marriage frays&nbsp;anew&nbsp;and Ted's literary stature overshadows her own, Sylvia's creative impulses surge. She funnels her fury and passion into her work, and her writing begins to flow forth in unstoppable bursts. \"I really feel like God is speaking through me,\" she exults.

Adapted from Mr. Evans's tell-all autobiography, the movie takes the audience on an intimate journey into the mind of this Hollywood legend.<\/p><p>Robert Evans lived the life that many only&nbsp;dream&nbsp;of. His film career started in 1956, at the oddest of places: poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. His good looks, charm, and overwhelming confidence captured the eye of screen legend Norma Shearer. She offered him a role in the picture \"Man of a Thousand Faces.\" After a glamorous, but short-lived, career as a movie star, Evans decided to try his hand at producing. Miraculously, at the age of 34, with no producing credits to his name, he landed a job as chief of production at Paramount Pictures. Evans ran the studio from 1966-1974. During his tenure, Evans was responsible for bringing some of the greatest films of the era to the screen, including \"The Godfather,\" \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"Love Story,\" \"The Odd Couple,\" \"The Conformist,\" \"Harold and Maude,\" and \"Chinatown.\"<\/p><p>By the early '80s, the \"Golden Boy\" of Hollywood was losing his luster. After a failed marriage to Ali MacGraw, a cocaine bust, and, finally, a rumored involvement in the \"Cotton Club\" murder, Evans disappeared into near-obscurity. Only through tremendous will and uncanny luck did he once again rise as \"the kid who stays in the picture.\"<\/p><p>Through the years, Evans's closest friends have included Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski, Henry Kissinger, and Dustin Hoffman. Long considered one of Tinseltown's most enduring bachelors, Evans has enjoyed meaningful love affairs with some of the most beautiful women of the past half-century, including Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, Lana Turner, Ali MacGraw, Cheryl Tiegs, Raquel Welch, and Margaux Hemingway.&nbsp;<strong><em>The Kid Stays in the Picture<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;shares gripping anecdotes about Evans's unusual friendships and follows the thread of his tumultuous love life.<\/p><p><strong><em>The Kid Stays in the Picture<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;is narrated by Mr. Evans in his distinctive voice and storytelling manner.

Single suburban mother Susan (Naomi Watts) works as a waitress at a diner, alongside feisty friend Sheila (Sarah Silverman). Her younger son Peter (Jacob Tremblay) is a playful 8-year-old. Taking care of everyone and everything is Susan&rsquo;s older son Henry (Jaeden Lieberher), age 11.

Susan discovers that the family next door, which includes Henry&rsquo;s kind classmate Christina (Maddie Ziegler), has a dangerous secret &ndash; and that Henry has devised a surprising plan to help.
