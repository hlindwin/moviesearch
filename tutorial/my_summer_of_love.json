Mona (played by Ms. Press), behind a spiky exterior, hides an untapped intelligence and a yearning for something beyond the emptiness of her daily life. Tamsin (Ms. Blunt) is well-educated, spoiled, and cynical. As they are complete opposites, each is wary of the other's differences when they first meet, but this coolness soon melts into mutual fascination, amusement, and attraction.<\\/p><p>Adding further volatility is Mona's older brother Phil (Paddy Considine), who has renounced his criminal past for religious fervor - which he tries to impose upon his sister.
