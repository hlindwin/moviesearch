A beautiful L.A. career woman, Kenya works as senior manager at a prestigious accounting firm, and is on the verge of making partner. But she has yet to find her own partner and a fulfilling personal life. It's not that she's stopped looking; her (mental) checklist is at the ready. After another Valentine's Day spent working late, Kenya agrees to a blind date with Brian Kelly (Simon Baker), a sexy and free-spirited landscape architect who turns out to be not exactly what she'd pictured for herself. Then again, she does need the yard of her new house fixed up...<\\/p><p>Her girlfriends Cheryl, Suzzette, and Nedra (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Golden Brooks, Taraji P. Henson) are there for her with advice, while Cheryl's new beau Walter (Mike Epps) shares a male perspective with Brian. Kenya's socially prominent parents Joyce and Edmond (Alfre Woodard, Earl Billings) and womanizing younger brother Nelson (Donald Faison) also voice their own opinions. But it's when her perfect match, Mark (Blair Underwood), enters the picture that Kenya is truly thrown into confusion. Ultimately, Kenya has to decide for herself and follow her heart - no matter where it takes her.<\\/p>\",\"in_theaters\":\"<p>January 29, 2006<\\/p>\",\"date_release\":\"2006-01-29\",\"division\":\"focus_features\",\"logo\":\"\",\"rating_img\":\"\",\"show_grid\":0,\"show_grid_filters\":0,\"show_in_theaters\":0,\"show_awards_intro\":0,\"meta_title\":\"Something New Movie | Official Website | Buy Now | Focus Features\",\"meta_desc\":\"Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) thought she had it all: a successful career, good friends and family.
